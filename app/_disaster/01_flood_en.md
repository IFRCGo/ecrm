# Flood

## Key facts

- Flooding is a common natural disaster. Acute and/or severe flooding can cause loss of life, significant infrastructure damage and displacement of the affected population.
- Floods are often characterised by difficulty in access. Depending on the severity, it can take days or weeks for floodwater to recede. 

## Main health impacts 

Drowning and trauma (injury) are most likely during a flood or in the immediate aftermath including the risk of Tetanus in unvaccinated individuals.
In the days, weeks (and sometimes months) following a flood, the main health concerns are:

Health concern | Mechanism
--- | ---
Diarrhoeal diseases | Contamination of water supplies by flood water, damaged or destroyed sanitation facilities, and poor hygiene practices.
Vector-borne diseases | Floods can result in an increase in breeding sites for mosquitoes, and after some time an increase in transmission of Dengue, Chikungunya and Malaria. Other vectors such as rats can be affected, bringing them in closer contact with humans leading to increase in incidence of Leptospirosis.
Respiratory illnesses, skin disease and vaccine preventable diseases | Significant population displacement and risk of overcrowded, communal emergency shelters.
Malnutrition | Flooding can lead to a loss of food stock and can increase the risk of acute malnutrition
Disruption to normal health services | Destruction and damage to health facilities and stock disrupt normal services impacting NCD, maternal and child health services.

## Risk factors leading to an outbreak/ epidemic 

- Poor water, sanitation and hygiene conditions
- Exposure to, and an increase in disease vectors
- Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged 
- Inadequate or crowded shelter 
- Lack of access to steady, appropriate food supplies 
- Lack of access to health care facilities including limited supplies at health facilities.

## Priority actions

### Critical steps

- Ensure triage, treatment, referral and transport for injured and “near drowning” patients
- Identify key disease risk factors and implement prevention and preparedness
- Identify and manage possible sources of toxic contamination.

### Surveillance
	
- Activate disease early warning and community based surveillance
- Survey vectors and breeding sites with measures to reduce vector density.

### Primary health care intervention
	
- Continuity of main service delivery including maternal services
- Specific primary care interventions for diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory tract infections, Hepatitis A, Typhoid, skin infections, snake and insect bites
- Treatment for “near drowning” and exposure
- Treatment for Malaria, Dengue and other vector-borne diseases
- Care of minor wounds and skin infections
- Tetanus immunization.

### Community based action and social mobilisation
	
- Implement SBCC focussing on prevention of water and vector-borne diseases
- Plan and implement emergency vaccination campaigns as needed
- Ensure procedures are in place to safely manage human and animal corpses 
- Ensure access to PSS
- Early detection, referral and treatment of people with diarrhoea, especially the most vulnerable  
- Psychosocial support for community members and staff/volunteers 
- Prevention of WASH related diseases:
  - Handwashing with soap 
  - Safe excreta disposal 
  - Safe drinking water 
  - Environmental sanitation.

### Coordination	
- Coordination between agencies and different sectors including WASH, Health, Nutrition and Shelter
- Coordination of volunteers.
