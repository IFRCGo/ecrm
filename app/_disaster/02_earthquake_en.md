# Earthquake

## Key facts

- Impact depends on the intensity of ground shaking and the building structure quality. Larger impact in areas of high population and building density. 
- Generally occur without any warning. Aftershocks can remain a significant hazard, causing further damage and increasing the psychological stress of both affected communities and humanitarian workers.
- Potential for large influx of search and rescue and medical teams.

## Main health impacts 


Health concern | Mechanism
--- | ---
Trauma or injury | Building collapse causes the majority (75%) of trauma, other injuries can occur from landslides or tsunamis. Mortality and injury peak is usually within the first 72 hours. 
Diarrhoeal diseases | Through interruption of water supplies, damaged or destroyed sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices 
Respiratory illnesses and vaccine preventable diseases | Significant population displacement and risk of overcrowded, communal emergency shelters
Vector-borne diseases | If an earthquake causes a break-down in solid waste management or sanitation services.

## Risk factors leading to an outbreak/ epidemic 

- Poor water, sanitation and hygiene conditions
- Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged 
- Inadequate or crowded shelter 
- Lack of access to steady, appropriate food supplies 
- Lack of access to health care facilities 
- Impact on psychosocial health of the population
- Decrease in appropriate infant and young child feeding practices
