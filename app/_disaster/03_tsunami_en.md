# Tsunami

## Key facts

Tsunamis are usually associated with earthquakes and cause high levels of destruction along coast lines. Initially, high levels of drowning, trauma and injuries are typical including Tetanus. This is followed by WASH and vector related diseases.

## Main health impacts 

The main health concerns are:

Health concern | Mechanism
--- | ---
Trauma or injury | Initial injuries from the earthquake are often complicated by areas flooding with the tsunami wave water. Additional trauma injuries from debris from the force of the tsunami wave also occur. High rates of infected wounds should be expected.
Diarrhoeal diseases | Contamination of water supplies, damaged or destroyed sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices.
Vector-borne diseases | Tsunamis can result in an increase in breeding sites for mosquitos, and after some time an increase in transmission of vector related disease.
Respiratory illnesses and vaccine preventable diseases | Significant population displacement and risk of overcrowded, communal emergency shelters.
Disruption to normal health services | Destruction and damage to health facilities and stock disrupt normal services. Disruption to NCD treatment and maternal and child health services.

## Risk factors leading to an outbreak/ epidemic 

- Poor water, sanitation and hygiene conditions
- Exposure to, and an increase in disease vectors
- Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged 
- Inadequate or crowded shelter 
- Lack of access to steady, appropriate food supplies 
- Lack of access or disruption of health services.

## Priority actions

### Critical steps

- Ensure triage, treatment, referral and transport for injured and “near drowning” patients
- Identify key disease risk factors and implement prevention and preparedness
- Identify and manage possible sources of toxic contamination.

### Surveillance
	
- Activate disease early warning systems and community based surveillance
- Survey vectors and breeding sites with measures to reduce vector density.


### Primary health care intervention

- Continuity of main service delivery, including maternal and child health services
- Specific primary care interventions for diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory tract infections, Hepatitis A, Typhoid, skin infections, snake and insect bites
- Treatment for “near drowning” and exposure
- Treatment for Malaria, Dengue and other vector-borne diseases
- Care of minor wounds and skin infections, including Tetanus immunization.


### Community based action and social mobilisation
	
- Implement SBCC interventions for prevention of water and vector-borne diseases
- Plan and implement emergency vaccination campaigns as needed
- Procedures in place to safely manage human and animal corpses and solid waste 
- Provision of psychosocial care for community members, staff and volunteers
- Early detection, referral and treatment of sick people, especially the most vulnerable  
- Prevention of water and sanitation related diseases:
	- Handwashing with soap 
	- Safe excreta disposal 
	- Safe drinking water 
	- Environmental sanitation

### Coordination	
- Coordination between agencies and sectors including WASH, Health, Nutrition & Shelter
- Coordination between rescue services and health services (including Level 1, 2 and 3 facilities)
- Coordination of volunteers.
