# Cyclone / Hurricane / Typhoon

## Key facts

Cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) are associated with damage to infrastructure from high winds and storm surges, and flooding.

## Main health impacts 

Trauma (injury) is most likely during a cyclone/hurricane/typhoon, or in the immediate aftermath. In the days, weeks (and sometimes months) following a cyclone/hurricane, the main health concerns are:

Health concern | Mechanism
--- | ---
Diarrhoeal diseases | Contamination of water supplies by flood water, damaged or destroyed sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices.
Vector-borne diseases | Flooding or stagnant water can increase the risk of breeding sites for vectors.
Respiratory illnesses and vaccine preventable diseases | Significant population displacement and risk of overcrowded, communal emergency shelters. 
Disruption to normal health services | Destruction and damage to health facilities and stock disrupt normal services impacting NCD treatment, and maternal and child health services.

## Risk factors leading to an outbreak/ epidemic 

- Poor WASH conditions
- Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged 
- Inadequate or crowded shelter 
- Lack of access to steady, appropriate food supplies 
- Lack of access to health care facilities.

## Priority actions

### Critical steps

- Ensure triage, treatment, referral and transport for injured and “near drowning” patients
- Identify key disease risk factors and implement prevention and preparedness
- Establish critical health services
- Identify and manage possible sources of toxic contamination

### Surveillance
	
- Activate disease early warning systems and community based surveillance
- Survey vectors and breeding sites with measures to reduce vector density.

### Primary health care intervention
	
- Continuity of health service delivery, including maternal and child health care, and NCD’s treatment
- Specific primary care interventions for diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory tract infections, Hepatitis A, Typhoid, skin infections, snake and insect bites
- Treatment for “near drowning” and exposure
- Treatment for malaria, dengue and other vector-borne diseases
- Care of minor wounds and skin infections, including Tetanus immunization.

### Community based action and social mobilisation
	
- Implement SBCC interventions aimed at preventing water and vector-borne diseases
- Plan and implement emergency vaccination campaigns as needed
- Procedures in place to safely manage human and animal corpses 
- Early detection, referral and treatment of all people with infectious disease symptoms, especially the most vulnerable 
- Psychosocial support for community members, and staff and volunteers 
- Prevention of WASH related diseases:
	- Handwashing with soap 
	- Safe excreta disposal 
	- Safe drinking water  
	- Environmental Sanitation
	- Food Safety.

### Coordination	
- Coordination between agencies and sectors including Health, Nutrition, WASH & Shelter
- Coordination between rescue services and health services (including level 1,2 and 3 facilities)
- Coordination of volunteers.
