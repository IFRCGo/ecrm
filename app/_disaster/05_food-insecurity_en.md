# Food insecurity / Drought

## Key facts

- Persistent food and nutrition insecurity continues to be a chronic problem globally. One in eight adults and one in four children worldwide are chronically malnourished.
- Drought is the most common cause of food shortages. 
- Other underlying factors include conflict, poverty and lack of agricultural infrastructure. 
- These factors are exacerbated by environmental degradation and climate change. 

## Main health impacts 

One of the main concerns with food insecurity is insufficient nutrient intake and subsequent malnutrition. Children and adults who are malnourished have an increased risk of severe forms of infections, and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. 

Unlike rapid onset disasters, food insecurity has a gradual or slow onset. Response to food insecurity includes nutrition specific interventions aimed at preventing or treating acute malnutrition, and nutrition sensitive interventions aimed at addressing the drought and food insecurity.

Health concern | Mechanism
--- | ---
Malnutrition including micronutrient deficiency | Insufficient nutrient intake, increased vulnerability to infection, morbidity and mortality. Vulnerable groups include children under five years, pregnant and lactating women (PLW), and people with chronic illness such as HIV and Tuberculosis. 
Diarrhoeal diseases | Poor WASH conditions can lead to diarrhoea, intestinal worms and enteric dysfunction. Lack of and/or delay in treatment and illness contributes to deteriorating nutritional status.
Vector-borne diseases | Illnesses contribute to worsening of nutritional status and make malnourished people more vulnerable.
Respiratory illnesses and vaccine preventable diseases | 
Increased risk for communicable disease outbreaks | Decrease access to WASH, population movement and increased vulnerability can lead to large scale outbreaks of Cholera, Measles and other infectious diseases.

## Risk factors leading to an outbreak/ epidemic 

- High levels of acute malnutrition in children and/or adults – particularly children under 5 years of age and PLW’s 
- Prolonged drought conditions
- Poor WASH conditions
- Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged 
- Inadequate or crowded shelter 
- Lack of access to health care facilities  
- Low vaccine coverage.

## Priority actions

### Critical steps

- Nutritional assessment and feeding programmes
- Active case finding and referral
- Rehabilitation of children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) through Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programming
- Rehabilitation of children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition MAM through CMAM 
- Integrate nutrition into the health system and ensure access to nutritional programs (not only for high impact specific measures but also for consultations)
- Identify key disease hazards and implement prevention and preparedness measures. In particular health hazards related to poor WASH and vaccine preventable disease.

### Surveillance
	
- Activate disease early warning systems and community-based surveillance

### Primary health care intervention
	
- Continuity of core service delivery
- Management of CMAM and patients with SAM/MAM without medical complications (those with complications should be referred to secondary health care facilities) 
- Vaccinations.

### Community based action and social mobilisation
	
- Screening and referral of patients with SAM and MAM
- SBCC for prevention of diarrhoeal disease, skin and eye infection
- Promotion of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices
- Plan and implement emergency vaccination campaigns as needed
- Prevention interventions including cash and food distribution, improved WASH access.

### Coordination	

- Coordination between agencies and sectors
- Coordination of volunteers.
