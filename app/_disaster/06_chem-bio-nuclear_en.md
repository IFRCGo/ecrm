# Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear insecurity

## Key facts

Events may be acute or chronic, from a known or unknown source, localized or widespread. It may be airborne, waterborne, food borne or transmitted through contaminated soil. 

## Main health impacts 

Health effects are specific to the agent, dose and route of exposure. The agent may be an irritant or may have specific toxicity. It can contaminate the skin and eyes or be inhaled or ingested. 

The main causes of mortality are poisoning leading to organ failure, asphyxia or neurological collapse. 

## Risk factors leading to an outbreak/ epidemic 

- Contaminated water and food
- Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged 
- Inadequate or crowded shelter.

## Priority actions

### Critical steps

- Rapid environmental and health risk assessment
- Definition of affected zone and forecast of new zones potentially affected (weather/wind patterns, downstream rivers, food chain)
- Definition of health risks, health impact and capacity of local health infrastructure to cope
- Transport of people away from zone of contamination and life/health care after displacement
- Decontamination of victims (where appropriate)
- Movement of at risk populations to “safe zones”
- System of triage, treatment, referral and transport in place for exposed patients with referral to secondary level of care of severe cases.

### Surveillance
	
- Activate disease early warning systems and community-based surveillance
- Surveillance for new exposures in the community and investigation of sources.

### Primary health care intervention
	
- Triage, stabilization and initial case management 
- Referral to secondary facilities for more severe cases
- Care for psychological trauma.

### Community based action and social mobilisation
	
- Prevention of exposure, including implementing SBCC for prevention of exposure through contaminated water and airborne transmission 
- Plan and implement emergency vaccination campaigns as needed 
- Treatment of minor exposures
- Early detection, referral and treatment of people with potential exposure.

### Coordination	

- Coordination with specialised agencies
- Coordination and safety of volunteers.
