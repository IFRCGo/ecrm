# Complex emergency / Population Movement

## Key facts

- Often results from a combination of hazards including manmade and natural.
- Underlying factors include conflict and drought
- Can result in significant population movement, epidemics, lack of access to health care and general insecurity.

## Main health impacts 

Complex emergencies often result in the collapse of the health system.  Insecurity often means additional or supplementary services are not always available.  The population is often affected by malnutrition, epidemics and poor health in general.

Health concern | Mechanism
--- | ---
Malnutrition/micronutrient deficiency | Insufficient nutrient intake, increased vulnerability to infection, morbidity and mortality. Vulnerable groups, children under five years of age, PLW, people with chronic illness such as HIV and TB 
Diarrhoeal diseases | Poor WASH conditions lead to diarrhoea, intestinal worms and enteric dysfunction. Lack of and/or delay in treatment and illness itself contributes to deteriorating nutritional status and makes malnourished people more vulnerable
Vector-borne diseases | Lack of suitable shelter, access to bed nets or other prevention measures increase exposure and risk of vector borne diseases
Respiratory illnesses and vaccine preventable diseases | Significant population displacement and by making malnourished people – especially children - more vulnerable
Increased risk for communicable disease outbreaks | Decrease access to WASH, population movement and increased vulnerability can lead to large scale outbreaks of Cholera, Measles and other infectious diseases
Disruption to normal health services | Destruction and damage to health facilities and stock disrupt normal services impacting NCDs and maternal and child health services.

## Risk factors leading to an outbreak/ epidemic 

- High levels of acute malnutrition in children and/or adults – particularly children under 5 years of age and pregnant or lactating women 
- Prolonged drought conditions exacerbated by climate change 
- Poor WASH conditions
- Displacement of affected populations, especially if prolonged 
- Inadequate or crowded shelter 
- Lack of access to health care facilities  
- Low vaccine coverage.

## Priority actions

### Critical steps

- Nutritional assessment and feeding programmes
- Active case finding and referrals
- Rehabilitation of children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) through Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programming
- Rehabilitation of children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition MAM through CMAM 
- Integrate nutrition into the health system and ensure access to nutritional programs (not only for high impact specific measures but also for consultations)
- Identify key disease hazards and implement prevention and preparedness measures. In particular, health hazards related to poor WASH and vaccine preventable diseases

### Surveillance
	
- Activate disease early warning systems and community- based surveillance

### Primary health care intervention
	
- Continuity of core service delivery
- Management of CMAM and patients with SAM/MAM without medical complications (those with complications should be referred to secondary health care facilities) 
- Vaccinations.

### Community based action and social mobilisation
	
- Screening and referral of patients with SAM and MAM
- SBCC for prevention of diarrhoeal disease, skin and eye infection and promotion of infant and young child feeding practices
- Plan and implement emergency vaccination campaigns as needed
- Prevention interventions including cash and food distribution, improved WASH access.

### Coordination	

- Coordination between agencies and sectors
- Coordination of volunteers.
