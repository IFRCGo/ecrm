# FACT SHEET (not translated to Spanish yet)

## Importance

Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old. It is responsible for killing around 525 000 children every year globally. Diarrheal disease is often a major concern in emergency situations, where WASH infrastructure may be damaged and access to health services impacted.

## Case definition	

Diarrhoea is defined as three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhea, nor is the passing of loose, "pasty" stools by breastfed babies.

<!-- start ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Alert/Epidemic threshold	

Above the threshold based on historical data.

</div> 
<!-- end ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->

## Risk assessment	

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** malnutrition rates, community and cultural practices, with a focus on behaviours related to WASH and accessing information and healthcare

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality

**Environment:** shelter, availability of safe food, availability of water and sanitation facilities, availability and access to health and social care.

<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate		

- 0.2% in endemic areas
- 0.6% in endemic areas with poor sanitary conditions

</div> 
<!-- end ## Attack rate -->

## Vulnerability	

- Individuals living in places with inadequate WASH are at a greater risk for diarrhoeal diseases, particularly young children 
- Individuals with chronic medical conditions (HIV infection) or malnutrition
- Individuals without ready access to rehydration therapy and health services.

<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent	

Rotavirus and Escherichia coli (E. coli), are the two most common infectious agents of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in low-income countries. Other pathogens such as Cryptosporidium and Shigella species may also be important. Location-specific causes also need to be considered.

## Reservoir/Host	

For some infectious agents: only humans (e.g. the most important rotaviruses, Shigella, etc.). For other infectious agents: animals and humans (e.g. E. coli, Cryptosporidium). 

</div> 
<!-- end ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->

## How the disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	

- Faecal Oral
- Contaminated food and unwashed hands
- Water contaminated with human waste (faeces)
- Fomites (such as toys and other environmental surfaces contaminated by stool) 

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period	

Depends on the agent. For example, less than 48 hours for rotaviruses, 3 - 8 days for E. coli, 2 - 10 days for Cryptosporidia, 1 - 3 weeks for Shigellae.

## Period of infectiousness	

- Adults excrete E. coli for approximately one week or less; in children it can be longer.
- Persons infected with Rotaviruses shed large quantities of virus in their faeces beginning two days before the onset of diarrhoea and for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms. Rotavirus may be detected in the stool of immunodeficient persons more than 30 days after infection.

## Clinical signs and symptoms	

- Three or more loose or liquid stools over the period of 24 hours 
- Possible stomach pains, fever, nausea and vomiting 
- Can cause dehydration, sepsis and death
- Can be watery diarrhoea (lasts several hours or days), and includes Cholera, bloody diarrhoea (also called Dysentery) and chronic diarrhoea (lasts 14 days or longer).


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms	

Cholera, non-infectious diarrhoea in chronic diseases of digestive tract.

## Diagnosis

- Stool sample for faecal leukocytes test
- Faecal lactoferrin assays
- Stool culture (E. coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia)
- Antigen testing (Cryptosporidium, Giardia)
- Toxin testing (C. difficile)

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

- Dehydration stage: No dehydration
  - Signs: Skin goes back normally when pinched, thirst has subsided, urine has been passed, pulse is strong.
  - Treatment: Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) at home; zinc supplementation in children up to 15 years. 
- Dehydration stage: Moderate dehydration
  - Signs: Restlessness and irritability, sunken eyes, dry mouth and tongue, increased thirst, skin goes back slowly when pinched, decreased urine, decreased tears, depressed fontanels in infants.
  - Treatment: ORS + very close observation; zinc supplementation in children up to 15 years.
- Dehydration stage: Severe dehydration
  - Signs: Lethargy or unconsciousness, very dry mouth and tongue, skin goes back very slowly when pinched ("tenting"), weak or absent pulse, low blood pressure, minimal or no urine.
  - Treatment: Intravenous (IV) therapy + antibiotics + ORS; zinc supplementation in children up to 15 years.
  
## Immunity	

Agent specific. 
Randomized controlled trials have shown that both monovalent and pentavalent rotavirus vaccines are 80- 90% efficacious against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in countries with very low, or low child and adult mortality. They are also 40%-60% efficacious in countries with high child mortality and high, or very high adult mortality. In most cases, vaccination in infancy provides protection against severe RVGE for at least 2 years.

# Which interventions are most effective for prevention and control? 

## PREVENTION AND CONTROL

Evidence of effectiveness | Activity
--- | ---		
<img width="40px" src="{{ '/assets/img/3-high.png' | relative_url }}"> High | Household water treatment (at the point of use e.g. in the home.) including training on use and regular monitoring/follow-up. If used properly, the following methods have been shown to reduce risk of disease: Chlorine; Filtration; Solar disinfection (SODIS) – in children under 5; Flocculent/disinfection combined; Boiling. Treatment method must be appropriate for the context.
