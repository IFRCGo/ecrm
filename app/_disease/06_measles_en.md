# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Measles is one of the leading causes of death in young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. In 2016 there were 89780 Measles deaths globally, marking the first year Measles deaths have fallen below 100 000 per year. A Measles outbreak occurs when the Measles vaccine coverage is low or has dropped below 95%. Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, it can spread very quickly but can be controlled with mass vaccination campaigns.

## Case definition	

Any person with fever AND maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash AND ONE of the following: cough, runny nose (coryza) or red eyes (Conjunctivitis) OR any person in whom a clinician suspects Measles


<!-- start ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Alert/Epidemic threshold	

The specific threshold must be developed based on local epidemiology and immunization programme objectives. The outbreak threshold may, and should, change as the incidence of Measles changes.

In countries with no recent Measles cases reported, a single case should trigger a detailed case investigation.


</div> 
<!-- end ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->

## Risk assessment	

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** malnutrition rates, community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality

**Environment:** immunisation coverage, shelter, availability and access to health and social care


<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate		

90% or greater among non-immune contacts.

</div> 
<!-- end ## Attack rate -->

## Vulnerability	

- Poorly nourished children and children with vitamin A deficiency
- Adults aged >20 years
- People with compromised immune systems, such as from Leukaemia and HIV infection 
- Pregnant women 
- Displaced populations.


<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->

## Infectious agent	

_Morbilli virus_

## Reservoir/Host	

Humans.

</div> 
<!-- end ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->

## How the disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	

Droplet

- Droplets of saliva/mucus from one person to another, mainly by coughing, sneezing.
- Close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions.


<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period	

12 to 14 days (range 7-21 days).

## Period of infectiousness	

Infected people can spread Measles to others from four days before up to four days after the rash appears.

## Clinical signs and symptoms	

- Can start with a high fever, runny nose, cold, cough, red and watery eyes and sometimes white spots inside the cheeks.
- Red blotchy rash appears after several days, starting on the back of the head and upper neck, and over about three days spreads to the rest of the body.
- In severe cases, serious complications include blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as Pneumonia. 
- Complications are more common in children under the age of five, or adults over the age of 20. Severe or complicated Measles is more likely among poorly nourished children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV infection or other diseases.
- In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care, up to 10% of Measles cases result in death. Women infected while pregnant are also at risk of severe complications and the pregnancy may end in miscarriage or preterm delivery.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms	

- Other diseases with rash and fever (e.g. _Parvo B19_ infection, rubella, Dengue fever).

## Diagnosis

- Detection of Measles-specific IgM antibody and Measles RNA by real-time RT-PCR are the most common methods for confirmation of Measles infection. 
- Efforts should be made to obtain a serum sample and throat swab (or nasopharyngeal swab) from suspected cases at first contact.



## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

- No specific antiviral treatment exists for the Measles virus.
- Severe complications from Measles can be avoided through supportive care that ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake and treatment of dehydration with WHO recommended ORS. This solution replaces fluids and other essential elements that are lost through diarrhoea or vomiting.
- All children in low income countries diagnosed with Measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart.

  
## Immunity	

- Natural immunity after infection is life-long.
- Vaccine efficacy is 95% at 12 months of age and 98% at 15 months of age. This increased to more than 99% after two doses of the vaccine is received.
- Vaccine provides life-long immunity.

# Which interventions are most effective for prevention and control? 

The primary control measure is vaccination.  Reduction in exposure to mosquitos through personnel protection or reducing vectors (spraying or environmental sanitation) is a useful supplementary activity. Large urban outbreaks of Yellow Fever are possible, so SBCC strategies should include urban and rural approaches.
