# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, in what is now South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.
 
The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered. There were more cases and deaths in 2014-2016 than all the previous years combined. The outbreak also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia. 

The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.

## Case definition	

**Routine surveillance**

**Suspected case:** Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment for usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine.

**Confirmed case:** A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation).

**Community-based surveillance**

Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area OR at least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine OR any sudden death.

During an Ebola outbreak, surveillance should use the case definitions described.

## Alert/epidemic threshold

Single case.

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** : type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality

**Environment:** : shelter, availability and access to health and social care

<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate

- Household attack rates are between 12 and 48%.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## Vulnerability

- Healthcare providers caring for Ebola patients
- Family and friends in close contact with Ebola patients
- Mourners who have direct contact with bodies during burial rituals
- People in contact with wild animals
- Sexual partners of Ebola survivors.

<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent

Ebola virus.

## Reservoir/Host

Humans, fruit bats, apes and monkeys.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)

-	Through direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes in, for example, the eyes, nose, or mouth) with blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola.
- Through the contact with objects (like needles and syringes) that have been contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick with Ebola or the body of a person who has died from Ebola.
- Through the direct contact with infected fruit bats, apes and monkeys.
- Possibly through during the sexual intercourse with a man who has recovered from Ebola.

<!-- start ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Alert/Epidemic threshold	

Twice the average number of cases seen in the previous three weeks for a location.

<!-- end ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->

## Risk assessment	

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices, chemoprophylaxis coverage

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality

**Environment:** presence of vectors, shelter, availability and access to health and social care.


<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate		

- It depends on the level of natural immunity of the population. Infections are often asymptomatic.

</div> 
<!-- end ## Attack rate -->

## Vulnerability	

- Infants, children under five years of age
- Pregnant women
- People living with HIV
- Non-immune migrants, mobile populations and travellers.


<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent	

There are five _Plasmodium_ (a parasite) species that cause Malaria in humans, and two of these species – _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ – pose the greatest threat.

## Reservoir/Host	

Humans (monkey for _P. knowlesi_, present in South-Eastern Asia, particularly on Borneo).

</div> 
<!-- end ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->

## How the disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	

Vector Borne

- _Anopheles_ mosquito bite. 
- The mosquitoes usually bite between sunset and sunrise during the night. 

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period	

Eight to ten days (range 2-21 days).

## Period of infectiousness	

People remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Recovering patients are no longer contagious to others and their return home or transfer to a general hospital is safe. Breastmilk may still be contagious for up to one month after recovery and sperm for up to nine months after the patient’s recovery.

</div> 
<!-- end ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->

<div class="hide profile2 profile3" markdown="1"> 

## Clinical signs and symptoms	

- Starts with sudden fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat
- Followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. There may also be bleeding under the skin, from the nose and from the gums, blood with coughing, and blood in the stools.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms	

Other haemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Rift Valley, Crimean-Congo), Malaria, Typhoid fever and Meningitis.

## Diagnosis

- Antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
- Antigen-capture detection tests
- Serum neutralization test
- Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay
- Electron microscopy
- Virus isolation by cell culture.

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

- Supportive care-rehydration with oral or IV fluids and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. 
  
## Immunity	

- People who recover from Ebola infection develop antibodies that last for at least ten years, possibly longer. It is not known if people who recover are immune for life or if they can become infected with a different species of Ebola.
