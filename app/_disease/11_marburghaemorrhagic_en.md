# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa (in a person with recent travel history to Zimbabwe) and Uganda. In 2008, two independent cases were reported in travellers who visited a cave inhabited by Rousettus bat colonies in Uganda.  Case fatality rates in Marburg haemorrhagic fever (MHF) outbreaks have ranged from 24% to 88%.


## Case definition	

**Routine surveillance**
**Suspected case:** Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment for usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine
**Confirmed case:** A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation)

**Community-based surveillance**
Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area OR at least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine OR any sudden death.
During a Marburg outbreak, surveillance should use the case definitions described in one of the references (see below).

## Alert/epidemic threshold
Single case.

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** : contact with fruit bats colonies
**Host:** community practices, cultural practices
**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics or sporadic cases, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality
**Environment:** : presence of fruit bats, availability and access to health and social care

## Attack rate
- 23% for family members sleeping in the same room with the patient
- 81% for those providing direct care.

## Vulnerable people
- People who work in or visit mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus bats (fruit bats) colonies
- Healthcare providers caring for patients with Marburg haemorrhagic fever
- Family and friends in close contact with Marburg haemorrhagic fever
- Mourners who have direct contact with bodies during burial rituals.

## Infectious agent
Marburg virus

## Reservoir/Host

Humans, non-human primates, Rousettus bats (fruit bats).

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)
-	Close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons 
-	Contact with the body of the deceased during burial ceremonies 
-	Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries 
-	Sexual contact with a man up to seven weeks after recovery 
-	Contact with fruit bats and probably apes and monkeys.

## Incubation period
Five to ten days (range 2-21 days).

## Period of infectiousness
People remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Recovering patients are no longer contagious to others and their return home or transfer to a general hospital is safe. Sperm may still be contagious for a period of three months after patient’s recovery.

## Clinical signs and symptoms
-	Starts abruptly with fever, severe headache, malaise, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea 
-	Usually followed by a rash and bleeding under the skin and from the nose, vagina and gums, blood with vomitus and in the stools 
-	In severe cases confusion, irritability and aggression is present.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms
Other haemorrhagic fevers (Ebola fever, Rift Valley fever, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo fever, Dengue), Malaria, Typhoid fever, Measles and some other infections.

## Diagnosis

-	Antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing
-	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
-	 IgM-capture ELISA can be used to confirm a case of MHF within a few days of symptom onset.

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)
-	Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. 
-	No specific treatment or vaccine is yet available for MHF.

## Immunity

- No information available.
