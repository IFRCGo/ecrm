# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Outbreaks associated with enterovirus 71 infection have been reported globally since the 1970’s, predominantly in the Asia-Pacific region and largely affecting children. Clinical manifestation of cases has been mostly typical of HFMD, with fever, skin eruptions on hands and feet, and vesicles in the mouth. Cases involving the central nervous system (CNS) and / or pulmonary oedema have also been observed.


## Case definition	

Febrile illness with papulovesicular rash on palms and soles, with or without vesicles/ulcers in the mouth. Rash may occasionally be maculopapular without vesicular lesion, and may also involve the buttocks, knees or elbows, particularly in younger children and infants.

## Alert/epidemic threshold
The number of cases reaches two standard deviations above the normal baseline OR two or more cases occur within an institution, indicating transmission within a cohort.

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:**  endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality

**Environment:** availability and access to health and social care.

## Attack rate
-	Possibly high among close contacts, but only a small proportion has symptomatic disease. The majority of the institutional outbreaks had less than 10% attack rates.

## Vulnerability
-	Infants and children younger than five years old 
-	Patients with EB71 infection
-	Patients at home care.


## Infectious agent
Coxsackievirus A16 and other coxsackieviruses, Enterovirus 71 

## Reservoir/Host

Humans.

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)
-	Contact with the nose and throat secretion, blister fluid or faeces of an infected person 
-	Swallowing recreational water (e.g. in swimming pools).


## Incubation period
Three to five days.

## Period of infectiousness
For EV71, viral shedding from the throat can occur up to two weeks after an acute EV71 infection, and virus can be isolated from stool for up to 11 weeks.

## Clinical signs and symptoms
-	Fever, reduced appetite, fatigue, sore throat, and after a few days sores in the mouth
-	A skin rash with red spots, and sometimes with blisters, may also develop over one or two days on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It may also appear on the knees, elbows, buttocks or genital area.
-	Some people, especially young children, may get dehydrated if they are not able to swallow enough liquids because of painful mouth sores
-	More severe clinical presentation with neurological symptoms such as Meningitis, Encephalitis and Polio-like paralysis may occur. 
-	It can be fatal in a small proportion of children, particularly those aged less than five years. These cases may experience a brief febrile illness and present with only subtle neurological signs before developing into acute refractory myocardial dysfunction and fulminant pulmonary oedema.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms
Herpetic gingivostomatitis, aphthous stomatitis, Scabies infestation, Chickenpox (varicella), Measles and Rubella.

## Diagnosis

-	Virus isolation
-	Virus identification (neutralisation test, RT-PCR, immunofluorescence assay)
-	Rapid diagnostic tests for clinical purposes.


## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)
-	There is no specific treatment for HFMD. 
-	Patients can take over-the-counter medications to relieve pain and fever   and use mouthwashes or sprays that numb mouth pain.


## Immunity
When someone gets HFMD, they develop immunity to the specific virus that caused their infection. However, because HFMD is caused by several different viruses, people can get the disease again.
