# FACT SHEET

## Importance

From the start of 2017, the vector-borne Zika virus infection was established in 84 countries and territories in Latin America, Caribbean, the United States of America, Africa, South Eastern Asia and the Pacific. The Zika virus continues to spread geographically to areas where competent vectors are present.


## Case definition	

Case definitions can change by region, depending on other diseases present and how many cases have been confirmed in the area. Check for the definition in your area.

**Suspected case:** A person presenting with rash and/or fever and at least ONE of the following signs or symptoms: arthralgia; or arthritis; or conjunctivitis (non-purulent/hyperaemic).

**Probable case:** A suspected case with presence of IgM antibody against Zika virus and an epidemiological link.

**Confirmed case:** A person with laboratory confirmation of recent Zika virus infection: presence of Zika virus RNA or antigen in serum or other samples (e.g. saliva, tissues, urine, whole blood) OR IgM antibody against Zika virus positive and PRNT90 for Zika virus with titre ≥20 and Zika virus PRNT90 titre ratio ≥ 4 compared to other flaviviruses AND exclusion of other flaviviruses


## Alert/epidemic threshold
At the local level a single Zika case may trigger action. At state or provincial level, the increase in reported cases above an established baseline for the same week or month in preceding years, or increasing vector density, may indicate impending epidemic activity. At national level, the detection of changes in virus serotype, subtype or genotype distribution, clinical severity or seropositivity rate, or the introduction of a Zika vector into a new ecological niche, are signals that should be investigated without delay

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality

**Environment:** presence of vectors, availability and access to health and social care.


## Attack rate
-	Infection rate: 73%
-	Symptomatic attack rate among infected: 18%.

## Vulnerability
-	A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her foetus during pregnancy. Zika is a cause of microcephaly and other severe foetal 


## Infectious agent
Zika virus

## Reservoir/Host

Non-human and human primates are likely the main reservoirs of the virus.

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)
-	Mosquito bite (Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus)
-	The mosquitoes usually bite during the daytime (peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening at dusk).
-	During pregnancy from the pregnant women to her foetus
-	Unprotected sex.
-	Unsafe blood transfusion (very likely but not confirmed).

## Incubation period
3-14 days.

## Period of infectiousness
Zika virus is present in blood from a few days to one week, but the virus remains in semen longer.

## Clinical signs and symptoms
-	People with Zika virus disease can have symptoms including mild fever, skin rash, red eyes, muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache. These symptoms normally last for two to seven days
-	Many people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms. Estimates suggest only one in five people show symptoms
-	Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly
-	Zika virus is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome.  It is a rare condition in which a person’s immune system attacks the peripheral nerves. People of all ages can be affected, but it is more common in adults and in males. Most people recover fully from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome are rare, which result in near-total paralysis. People with Guillain-Barré syndrome should be treated and monitored; some may need intensive care. Treatment includes supportive care and some immunological therapies.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms
Dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile virus infection, Yellow fever, Malaria and other infections.

## Diagnosis

-	PCR (polymerase chain reaction) 
-	Virus isolation from blood samples.


## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)
-	Zika virus disease is usually mild and requires no specific treatment. 
-	People sick with Zika virus should get plenty of rest, drink enough fluids, and treat pain and fever with common medicines. If symptoms worsen, they should seek medical care and advice. 
-	In areas with Dengue and Zika occurring in the same areas, all suspected cases, especially pregnant women, should be referred to the health facility
-	There is currently no vaccine available.


## Immunity
Once a person has been infected, they are likely to be protected from future infections.
