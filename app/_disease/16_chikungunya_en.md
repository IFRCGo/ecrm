# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Chikungunya has been identified in over 60 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Chikungunya virus often causes large outbreaks with high attack rates, affecting one-third 


## Case definition	

**Clinical criteria:** acute onset of fever >38.5°C and severe arthralgia/arthritis not explained by other medical conditions.

**Epidemiological criteria:** residing or having visited epidemic areas, having reported transmission within 15 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

**Suspect case:** a patient meeting both the clinical and epidemiological criteria

**Confirmed case:** a suspect patient with laboratory confirmation


## Alert/epidemic threshold
One confirmed case, if there is no known outbreak already under investigation.

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of emergency, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality

**Environment:** presence of vectors, shelter, availability and access to health and social care


## Attack rate
Chikungunya affects one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating.

## Vulnerability
-	Older people (≥65 years) 
-	Newborns infected around the time of birth 
-	People with medical conditions 

## Infectious agent
Chikungunya virus

## Reservoir/Host

Non-human and human primates are likely the main reservoirs of the virus; other potential reservoirs are various vertebrates.

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)
-	From human to human through mosquito bite (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and some other mosquito vectors in Africa)
-	The mosquitoes usually bite during the daytime (peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening at dusk).
-	Chikungunya virus is transmitted rarely from mother to newborn around the time of birth
-	Blood-borne transmission is possible.

## Incubation period
Four to eight days (range 2-12 days).

## Period of infectiousness
The virus circulates in the blood of infected humans for several days, at approximately the same time that they have Chikungunya Fever. Aedes mosquitoes acquire the virus when they feed on an individual during this period.

## Clinical signs and symptoms
-	Characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain
-	Other common signs and symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash
-	The joint pain is often very debilitating, but usually lasts for a few days or may be prolonged to weeks
-	Most patients recover fully, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months, or even years
-	Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms
Dengue, Leptospirosis, Malaria, Meningitis, Zika and other infections.

## Diagnosis

-	PCR (polymerase chain reaction) 
-	Virus isolation from blood samples
-	Serological tests (ELISA).

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)
-	There is no specific antiviral drug treatment for Chikungunya. 
-	Treatment is directed primarily at relieving the symptoms, including joint pain using anti-pyretics, optimal analgesics and fluids. 
-	There is no commercial Chikungunya vaccine


## Immunity
-	Recovery from an infection will confer life-long immunity.
