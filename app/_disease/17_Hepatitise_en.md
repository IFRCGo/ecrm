# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Every year, there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections globally, and 3.3 million symptomatic cases of Hepatitis E. In 2015, the WHO estimated there was 44,000 deaths globally (accounting for 3.3% of the mortality due to viral Hepatitis). 
The outbreaks usually follow periods of faecal contamination of drinking water supplies and may affect several hundred to several thousand people. The outbreaks usually occur in situations with limited access to safe WASH and health services, including times of conflict, and in population movement settings.


## Case definition	

**Presumptive case:** clinical criteria: discrete onset of an acute illness with signs/symptoms of (i) acute infectious illness (e.g. fever, malaise, fatigue) and (ii) liver damage (e.g. anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, right upper quadrant tenderness, AND/OR raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels more than ten times the upper limit of normal).

**Confirmed case:** clinical criteria AND biomarker or epidemiological criteria: IgM anti-HEV positive OR Epidemiological link with a confirmed cased.

## Alert/epidemic threshold

An outbreak of Hepatitis E is often suspected by a Health worker, who notices an unusual number of patients with acute jaundice syndrome within a short period of time. These patients present with one or more of the following features: similar clinical symptoms, residence in the same area or location, sharing the same water supply.

Some other features that may suggest an outbreak of Hepatitis E include: one or more confirmed maternal deaths following jaundice, a recent breakdown in water quality (e.g. floods), recent population movement/displacement.

If baseline information from the same geographical area for previous years is available, it can be used to verify whether the number of cases in the present year is unusually high compared to that in previous years over the same period.

For acute jaundice syndrome in emergency settings, alert thresholds of “five or more cases with acute jaundice syndrome in one location in one to a few weeks” and of “five cases with acute jaundice syndrome or 1.5 times the baseline rate” have been suggested to help early detection of potential outbreaks of Hepatitis E.

e, if there is no known outbreak already under investigation.

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality

**Environment:** shelter, availability of safe food and water, availability and access to health and social care

<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate

-	During the outbreaks, overall attack rates have varied widely from 1% to above 15%.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## Vulnerability

-	Pregnant women, particularly those in the second and third trimester 
-	Persons with pre-existing chronic liver disease
-	Immunosuppressed persons such as those receiving chemotherapy or transplant recipients or HIV carriers.

<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent

Hepatitis E virus

## Reservoir/Host

Human (for Hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2 - genotypes responsible for epidemics), animals – pigs, wild boar, deer (genotypes 3 and 4, responsible for sporadic cases).

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)

-	Through faecal contaminated drinking water
-	Person to Person
-	Consumption of uncooked/undercooked pork or deer meat, meat products or organs (e.g. liver)
-	Consumption of shellfish
-	Transfusion of infected blood products; and
-	Vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her 

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period

4-6 weeks (range 2-10 weeks).

## Period of infectiousness

The period of infectiousness has not been clearly determined, but virus excretion in the stool has been demonstrated from one week prior to 30 days after the onset of jaundice. Chronically infected persons (for genotype 3 only) shed the virus as long as they are infected.

## Clinical signs and symptoms

-	Individuals infected with Hepatitis E virus often have no symptoms
-	The incubation period following exposure to the hepatitis E virus ranges from two to ten weeks, with an average of five to six weeks
-	Symptomatic infection is most common in young adults aged 15–40 years of age
-	An initial phase of mild fever, reduced appetite (anorexia), nausea and vomiting, lasting for a few days; some persons may also have abdominal pain, itching (without skin lesions), skin rash, or joint pain
-	Jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and sclera of the eyes), with dark urine and pale stools; and a slightly enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly)
-	In rare cases, acute Hepatitis E can be severe, and results in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure); these patients are at risk of death. Fulminant Hepatitis occurs more frequently when hepatitis E occurs during pregnancy.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms

Other viral Hepatitis, Yellow fever, Leptospirosis, Dengue fever, falciparum Malaria.

## Diagnosis

-	Cases of Hepatitis E are not clinically distinguishable from other types of acute viral Hepatitis. 
-	Definitive diagnosis of Hepatitis E infection is usually based on the detection of specific IgM antibodies to the virus in a person’s blood.


## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

-	There is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute Hepatitis E. 
-	As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required. Hospitalization is required for people with fulminant hepatitis, however, and should also be considered for symptomatic pregnant women.
-	Hepatitis E vaccine is currently registered only in China. The WHO does not currently recommend its use in other countries.

## Immunity

It is still unclear whether the natural infection results in life-long immunity and is there a possibility for reinfection.
