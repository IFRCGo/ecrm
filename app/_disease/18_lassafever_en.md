# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. The overall case-fatality rate is 1%. The observed case-fatality rate among patients hospitalized with severe cases of Lassa 


## Case definition	

**Suspected case:** Known exposure to a person suspected to have Lassa fever AND Fever >38°C for less than three weeks PLUS Absence of signs of local inflammation AND two major signs or one major and two minor signs.

**Major signs:** bleeding, swollen neck or face, conjunctiva or subconjunctival haemorrhage, spontaneous abortion, petechial or haemorrhagic rash, new onset of tinnitus or altered hearing, persistent hypotension, absence of clinical response after 48 hrs to antimalarial and/or broad spectrum antibiotic therapy.

**Minor signs:** headache, sore throat, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain /tenderness, chest/retrosternal pain, cough, diarrhoea, generalized myalgia or arthralgia, profuse weakness

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality

**Environment:** presence of multimammate rats, shelter, availability of safe food and water, availability and access to health and social care.

<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate

-	The secondary attack rate for Lassa fever in nosocomial settings appears to be quite low (as long as adequate barrier nursing is maintained).

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## Vulnerability

-	Those who live in or visit endemic regions, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria and have exposure to the multimammate rat
-	Women in the third trimester of pregnancy.

<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent
Lassa virus

## Reservoir/Host

Multimammate rat (Mastomys). Rats infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)

-	The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces.
-	Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevention and control
-	Lassa virus may be spread in contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles
-	Unprotected Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported
-	Casual contact (including skin-to-skin contact without exchange of body fluids) does not spread Lassa virus

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period

2-21 days.

## Period of infectiousness

People remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Sperm may still be contagious for a period of three months after the patient’s

## Clinical signs and symptoms

-	About 80% of people who become infected with Lassa virus have no symptoms
-	One in five infections result in severe disease, where the virus affects several organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys
-	The onset of the disease, when it is symptomatic, is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness, and malaise
-	After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain may follow. In severe cases facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure may develop
-	Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the later stages
-	Deafness occurs in 25% of patients who survive the disease. In half of these cases, hearing returns partially after 1–3 months
-	Transient hair loss and gait disturbance may occur during recovery.

## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms

Other haemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Rift Valley, Crimean-Congo, Dengue), malaria, typhoid fever, measles, shigellosis and other infections

## Diagnosis

-	Laboratory specimens may be hazardous and must be handled with extreme care. Lassa virus infections can only be diagnosed definitively in the laboratory using the following tests:
-	Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay
-	Antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
-	Antigen detection tests
-	Virus isolation by cell culture.

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

-	The antiviral drug Ribavirin seems to be an effective treatment for Lassa fever if given early during the clinical illness. There is no evidence to support the role of Ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for Lassa fever.
-	There is currently no vaccine that protects against Lassa fever.

## Immunity

-	Immunity against reinfection does occur after recovery from the illness but it is not known how long this immunity lasts.
