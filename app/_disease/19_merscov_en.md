# FACT SHEET

## Importance

MERS-CoV was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, with 27 countries now having reported cases. Approximately 35% of MERS-CoV cases are fatal, however this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases may be missed by existing surveillance systems. Until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.


## Case definition	

**Probable case**
- Definition 1: A febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) AND direct epidemiologic link with a laboratory-confirmed
MERS-CoV case AND testing for MERS-CoV is unavailable, negative on a single inadequate specimen or inconclusive.

- Definition 2: A febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) that cannot be explained fully by any other aetiology AND the person resides in or has travelled in the Middle East, or in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred; AND testing for MERS-CoV is inconclusive.

- Definition 3: An acute febrile respiratory illness of any severity AND direct epidemiologic link with a confirmed MERS-CoV
Case AND testing for MERS-CoV is inconclusive.

**Confirmed case:** A person with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms


## Alert/epidemic threshold
Single case

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** contact with Dromedary camels

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality

**Environment:** presence of Dromedary camels, availability and access to health and social care


## Attack rate
-	Secondary attack rate among household contacts: 1.3%.

## Vulnerability
-	People with exposure to camels
-	Close contacts of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV
-	Health personnel not using recommended infection control precautions
-	Older people 
-	People with weakened immune systems 
-	People with chronic diseases such as renal disease, Cancer, chronic lung disease, and Diabetes.


## Infectious agent
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus

## Reservoir/Host

Dromedary camels, humans.

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)
-	The virus does not pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient.
-	Human to human transmission has been limited to date, and has been identified among family members, patients, and health care workers.
-	The route of transmission from animals to humans is not fully understood, but Dromedary camels are a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of infection in humans.


## Incubation period
2-14 days.

## Period of infectiousness
The duration of infectivity for MERS-CoV infection is unknown. While standard precautions should always be applied, additional barrier nursing precautions should be used for the duration of symptomatic illness and continued for 24 hours after the resolution of symptoms.

## Clinical signs and symptoms
-	The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection ranges from no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death
-	A typical presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present
-	Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. 
-	Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. 


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms
Common cold, Influenza, Avian influenza, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pneumonia, RSV infection

## Diagnosis

-	Real time polymerase chain reaction
-	Serology testing (for surveillance purpose only).

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)
-	No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient’s clinical condition.


## Immunity
-	It is not clearly understood whether a naturally acquired immunity provides a lifelong protection of reinfection.
