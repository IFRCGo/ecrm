# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Monkeypox is a rare disease first discovered in monkeys and in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has now been reported in humans in several Central and Western Africa countries, and the United States of America. 

## Case definition	

**Clinical criteria:** rash (macular, papular, vesicular, or pustular; generalized or localized; discrete or confluent), fever (subjective or measured temperature of >99.3° F [> 37.4° C]), other Clinical signs and symptoms (chills and/or sweats, headache, backache, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath).

**Epidemiologic criteria:** exposure to an exotic or wild mammalian pet with clinical signs of illness (e.g., conjunctivitis, respiratory symptoms, and/or rash) OR exposure to an exotic or wild mammalian pet with or without clinical signs of illness that has been in contact with either a mammalian pet or a human with Monkeypox OR exposure to a suspect, probable, or confirmed human case of Monkeypox.

**Laboratory criteria:** isolation of Monkeypox virus in culture OR demonstration of Monkeypox virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction testing of a clinical specimen OR demonstration of virus morphologically consistent with an orthopoxvirus by electron microscopy in the absence of exposure to another orthopoxvirus OR demonstration of presence of orthopoxvirus in tissue using immunohistochemical testing methods in the absence of exposure to another orthopoxvirus.
 
**Case classification**

**Suspect case:** meets one of the epidemiologic criteria AND fever or unexplained rash AND two or more other signs or symptoms with onset of first sign or symptom <21 days after last exposure meeting epidemiologic criteria.

**Probable case:** meets one of the epidemiologic criteria AND fever AND vesicular-pustular rash with onset of first sign or symptom <21 days after last exposure meeting epidemiologic criteria OR if rash is present but the type is not described, demonstrates elevated levels of IgM antibodies reactive with orthopoxvirus between at least days 7 to 56 after rash onset.

**Confirmed case:** meets one of the laboratory criteria.

## Alert/epidemic threshold
Single case.

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality

**Environment:** presence of natural reservoirs, availability and access to health and social care.


## Attack rate
-	3-28% in recent outbreaks among close contacts.

## Vulnerability

-	People in close contact with animals (including the animal blood and bodily fluids) 
-	Infection is more severe in younger people.


## Infectious agent	

Monkeypox virus

## Reservoir/Host	

Many animals (rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian rats, striped mice, dormice, prairie dogs and primates), humans.

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	
- 	Direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals (monkey, prairie dogs, rats, squirrels, and others), during bite or scratch, bush meat preparation, direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, or indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated bedding.
-	Eating inadequately cooked meat of infected animals is a possible risk factor.
-	Close contact with infected respiratory tract secretions, skin lesions of an infected person or objects recently contaminated by patient fluids or lesion materials.
-	Via droplet respiratory particles usually requiring prolonged face-to-face contact.

## Incubation period	

6-16 days (range 5-21 days).

## Period of infectiousness	

First week of rash.


## Signs and symptoms	

-	The invasion period (0-5 days) is characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy).
-	The skin eruption period (within one to three days after the appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected. Evolution of the rash from maculopapules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately ten days which may last up to three weeks.
-	Some patients develop severe lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) before the appearance of the rash, which is a distinctive feature of Monkeypox compared to other similar diseases.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms

Smallpox, Chickenpox, Measles, bacterial skin infections, Scabies, Syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.

## Diagnosis

-	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
-	Antigen detection tests
-	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay
-	Virus isolation by cell culture.

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

-	There are no specific treatments or vaccines available for Monkeypox infection.
-	Vaccination against Smallpox has been proven to be 85% effective in preventing Monkeypox in the past however the vaccine is no longer available to the public following global Smallpox eradication. Nevertheless, prior Smallpox vaccination will likely result in a milder disease course.

  
## Immunity	

-	No information available.
