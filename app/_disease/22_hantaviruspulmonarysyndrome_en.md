# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in humans caused by infection with a Hantavirus. Case fatality ratio for HPS is 38%.
Numerous individual cases and small clusters of Hantavirus cases have been reported in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Panama, USA, Uruguay and Venezuela. Large outbreaks have been rare and have usually been associated with human disturbance and land-use changes or with unusual environmental events such as increased rainfall or periodic bamboo flowering. 


## Case definition	

**Clinical case definition:** An illness characterized by one or more of the following clinical features: a  febrile illness (i.e., temperature greater than 101.0° F (greater than 38.3° C) characterized by bilateral diffuse interstitial oedema that may radiographically resemble acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen, developing within 72 hours of hospitalization, and occurring in a previously healthy person; an unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death, with an autopsy examination demonstrating noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema without an identifiable cause.

**Laboratory criteria for diagnosis:** detection of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin M or rising titres of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin G OR detection of hantavirus-specific ribonucleic acid sequence by polymerase chain reaction in clinical specimens.
Detection of hantavirus antigen by immunohistochemistry.

**Case Classification**

**Confirmed:** A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.

## Alert/epidemic threshold
Single case.

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality
Environment: presence of reservoirs, availability and access to health and social care

<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate
-	For Andes virus: 2.5%.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## Vulnerability

Anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry Hantavirus is at risk of HPS.

<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent	

Hantaviruses (i.e. New World Hantaviruses, Sin nombre, New York, Back Creek and Bayou Hantaviruses in Northern America, Andes and other Hantaviruses in Central and South America).

## Reservoir/Host	

Rodents, specific for each Hantavirus (deer mouse for Sin nombre, white-footed mouse for New York, cotton rat for Black Creek, rice rat for Bayou and Andes Hantaviruses); humans (for Hantaviruses present in South America only).

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	

-	Breathing in the virus. This may happen when rodent urine and droppings containing hantavirus are stirred up into the air.
-	Touching eyes, nose or mouth after touching rodent droppings, urine, or nesting materials that contain the virus.
-	A bite from an infected rodent
-	Close contact with individuals with HPS (for Andes virus only)

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period	

7-42 days.

## Period of infectiousness	

Andes virus (ANDV)  is the only Hantavirus for which person-to-person transmission has been proven. Person-to-person transmission of ANDV occurs mainly in family clusters or, less commonly, after activities in which close contact with an infected case-patient has occurred.

<div class="hide profile2 profile3" markdown="1"> 

## Clinical signs and symptoms	

-	Early symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups (thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders).
-	Four to ten days after the initial phase appear coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a “…tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face” as the lungs fill with fluid. PHS is fatal in 38% patients.

## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms

Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Pneumonia, Plagues, tularaemia, Q fever, Anthrax and other diseases.

## Diagnosis

-	A positive serological test result
-	Evidence of viral antigen in tissue by immunohistochemistry, or the presence of amplifiable viral RNA sequences in blood or tissue, with compatible history of HPS.

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

-	There is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for hantavirus infection. However, if infected individuals are recognized early and receive medical care in an intensive care unit, they may do better.
-	 In intensive care, patients are intubated and given oxygen therapy to help them through the period of severe respiratory distress.

## Immunity	

Immune response towards Hantaviruses is long-lasting.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## Prevention

-	Informing people where there is a risk of HPS
-	Reduction of rodent habitat around homes, work places, and recreational areas, including removal of brush, rock piles, junk, cluttered firewood, and possible rodent food supplies, such as pet and wild animal food
-	Safely clean up after rodents
-	Early identification and referral of possible cases for treatment and medical surveillance of close contacts
-	Health promotion.
