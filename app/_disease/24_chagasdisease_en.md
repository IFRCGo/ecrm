# FACT SHEET

## Importance

About six million to seven million people worldwide, mostly in Latin America, are estimated to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease 

## Case definition	

Any individual who, as a result of a screening programme or of testing as a possible case, was positive for antibodies against T. cruzi in two serological (ELISA) assays.

<!-- start ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Alert/epidemic threshold
Significant increase above historical averages in endemic countries.
A single case of disease as a result of local transmission in non-endemic countries.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality

**Environment:** presence of natural reservoirs and vectors, availability and access to health and social care, shelter and housing, environmental sanitation. 

<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate
-	It can be below 10% or up to 100% in some epidemics.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## Vulnerability

-	People living in rural areas, in poor conditions.
-	People who have suppressed immune systems (for example, due to HIV or chemotherapy)

<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent	

Trypanosoma cruzi (parasite).

## Reservoir/Host	

Wild animals (e.g. armadillos, raccoons, opossums, and rodents), domestic animals, humans.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)
	
- 	T. cruzi parasites are mainly transmitted by contact with faeces/urine of infected blood-sucking triatomine bugs. They usually bite an exposed area of the skin such as the face, and the bug defecates close to the bite. The parasites enter the body when the person instinctively smears the bug faeces or urine into the bite, the eyes, the mouth, or into any skin break.
-	Less often, T. cruzi can be transmitted by the consumption of food contaminated with T. cruzi, blood transfusion from infected donors; from an infected mother to child transmission during pregnancy or childbirth; organ transplants using organs from infected donors; and laboratory accidents.

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period	

7-14 days.

## Period of infectiousness	

Reservoirs of T. cruzi are infectious for bugs as long as the parasite is present in the blood.

## Clinical signs and symptoms

-	The initial acute phase lasts for about two months after infection. During this phase, in most cases symptoms are absent, or mild and unspecific. In less than 50% of people bitten by a triatomine bug, characteristic first visible signs can be a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye. Additionally, they can present with fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, difficulty in breathing, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain.
-	During the chronic phase, the parasites are hidden mainly in the heart and digestive muscles. Up to 30% of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 10% suffer from digestive (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon), neurological or mixed alterations. In later years the infection can lead to sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmias or progressive heart failure caused by the destruction of the heart muscle and its nervous system.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms

Non-Chagas cardiomyopathy and diseases of digestive system, Typhoid fever, visceral Leishmaniosis and some congenital infections.

## Diagnosis

-	The diagnosis of Chagas disease can be made by observation of the parasite in a blood smear by microscopic examination.

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

-	Chagas disease can be treated with antibiotics. If given soon after infection, antibiotics are almost 100% effective in curing the disease (if given at the onset of the acute phase including the cases of congenital transmission). The efficacy diminishes the longer a person has been infected
  
## Immunity	

None. A person who has had Chagas disease and has been cured can be re-infected through any of the routes of transmission.
