# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Anthrax continues to be reported from many countries in domesticated and wild herbivores, especially where livestock vaccination programmes are inadequate or have been disrupted.

Humans generally acquire the disease directly or indirectly from infected animals, or occupational exposure to infected or contaminated animal products. Control in livestock is therefore the key to reduced incidence. The disease is generally regarded as being non-contagious because human to human transmission is rare (cutaneous anthrax only).

## Case definition	

**Clinical description:** an illness with acute onset characterised by several clinical forms  (cutaneous: skin lesion evolving over two to six days from a papular through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar invariably accompanied by oedema that may be mild to extensive; gastrointestinal: abdominal distress characterised by nausea, vomiting, anorexia and followed by fever; pulmonary (inhalation): brief prodrome resembling acute viral respiratory illness, followed by rapid onset of hypoxia, dyspnea and high temperature, with X-ray evidence of mediastinal widening; meningeal: acute onset of high fever possibly with convulsions and loss of consciousness, meningeal signs and symptoms.

**Laboratory criteria for diagnosis:** laboratory confirmation by one or more of the following: demonstration of B. anthracis in a clinical specimen by microscopic examination of stained smears of vesicular fluid, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, stools, etc. OR isolation of B. anthracis from a clinical specimen (e.g. blood, lesions, discharges) OR positive serology (ELISA, Western blot, toxin detection, chromatographic assay, fluorescent antibody test (FAT)).

**Case classification**

**Suspected:** A case that is compatible with the clinical description and has an epidemiological link to confirmed or suspected animal cases or contaminated animal products.

**Probable:** A suspected case that has a positive reaction to allergic skin test (in non-vaccinated individuals)

**Confirmed:** A suspected case that is laboratory-confirmed.

## Alert/epidemic threshold

Single case.


## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality

**Environment:** immunisation coverage among animals, availability of safe food, availability and access to health and social care

<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate

-	Generally low and depends on the type of exposure.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## Vulnerability

-	People who are working with animals or animal products such as wool, hides or hair.
-	People who eat raw or undercooked meat from infected animals.
-	People who inject drugs.
-	People with Gastrointestinal and Pulmonary anthrax have poorer prognosis.

<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent	

Bacillus anthracis (bacterium). When conditions are not conducive to growth and multiplication of the bacilli, they tend to form spores. Within the infected host the spores germinate to produce the vegetative forms which multiply, eventually killing the host.

## Reservoir/Host

Domestic and wild animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer.

</div> 
<!-- end -->

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	

- 	People get infected with Anthrax when spores get into the body. This can happen when people breathe in spores, eat food or drink water that is contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the skin or when injecting drugs.

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period

Two to six days (range: few hours to three weeks).

## Period of infectiousness	

Humans are not infectious.

## Clinical signs and symptoms

-	Cutaneous, or skin, Anthrax is the most common form. It is usually contracted when a person with a break in their skin, such as a cut or abrasion, comes into direct contact with Anthrax spores. The resulting itchy bump rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people can then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever and vomiting. Cutaneous anthrax must be treated quickly. Appropriate medical evaluation and treatment are essential.
-	Gastrointestinal anthrax is caught from eating meat from an infected animal. It causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning but these can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhoea. Appropriate medical evaluation and treatment are essential.
-	The most severe form of human anthrax is called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Though the rarest, it is the form of human anthrax causing the most current concern. This form of the disease is caused when a person is directly exposed to a large number of anthrax spores suspended in the air, and breathes them in. The first symptoms are similar to those of a common cold, but this can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock. Appropriate medical evaluation and treatment are essential.

## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms

Boil (early lesion), arachnid bites, ulcer (especially tropical); erysipelas, Glanders, Plague, syphilitic chancre, ulceroglandular tularaemia; clostridial infection; rickettsial diseases; orf, vaccinia and cowpox, rat bite fever, Leishmaniasis, Diphtheria, Tonsillitis, streptococcal angina, food poisoning, acute abdomen, Pneumonia.

## Diagnosis

-	To measure antibodies or toxin in blood
-	To test directly for Bacillus anthracis in a sample of blood, skin lesion swab, spinal fluid or respiratory secretions.

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

-	All types of Anthrax can be prevented and treated with antibiotics. 
-	There is a vaccine licensed to prevent Anthrax, but it is only recommended for routine use in certain groups of at-risk adults.

  
## Immunity	

Anthrax infection results in long-term immunity.
