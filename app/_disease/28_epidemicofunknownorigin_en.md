# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Occasionally, an outbreak or cluster of disease is seen in a population for which the cause is unclear. These outbreaks may be due to a new or modified pathogen, a natural toxin, an initially undetected release of a chemical, or over-exposure to ionizing radiation from an unknown source. Careful history taking and review of epidemiology may identify one or more possible causes for further specialised investigation. 

## Case definition	

It will be developed once the outbreak is detected.



## Alert/epidemic threshold
Cluster of cases with similar clinical manifestations, but with unknown origin or cause.


## Risk assessment

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement
**Host:** routine immunisation coverage, community practices, cultural practices
**Agent:** endemic diseases, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality
**Environment:** presence of potential reservoirs and vectors, availability of safety food and water, availability and access to health and social care.


## Attack rate
Unknown

## Vulnerability

Unknown, but initial cases may indicate the most vulnerable.


## Infectious agent	

Unknown

## Reservoir/Host

Unknown.

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	

Unknown at the beginning of epidemic. Efforts should be made to identify modes of transmission, particularly a possibility for human-to-human transmission.

## Incubation period

Unknown

## Period of infectiousness	

Unknown

## Clinical signs and symptoms

Any. Initial outbreak investigation and descriptive epidemiology should provide some information.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms

N/A

## Diagnosis

N/A


## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

No vaccine. Treatment is based on symptoms and clinical manifestations.

  
## Immunity	

Unknown


# Indicators and targets â€“ generic 
The indicators and targets below can be adapted to specific contexts and should be used for monitoring and evaluation of: i) progress of the epidemic and characteristics, and ii) measuring Red Cross/Crescent activities.  
 

<!-- start ## Epidemic characteristics and progression	 -->

## Epidemic characteristics and progression  - select those that are applicable 

Indicator | Target
--- | ---
Suspected cases / deaths per week (disaggregate by age, sex) |	# 
Confirmed cases / deaths per week (disaggregate by age, sex) |	#
Case-fatality rate |	%
Attack rate |	% 
Weekly incidence rate (per 1000 or 10000) |	-	
Number of community care or isolation units established  |	# 
Number of admissions per care centre or isolation unit |	# 
	

<!-- end ## Epidemic characteristics and progression	 -->

## Red Cross/Crescent activities - select those that are applicable

Indicator | Target
--- | ---
Number of volunteers trained |	# 
Suspected cases detected by volunteers and referred to health facility  |	# 
Social and behaviour change communication (SBCC) plan developed |	Plan available 
Functional feedback mechanism in place |	# and type 
Households visited by volunteers (door-to-door visits) |	# or % 
People who attended group sessions held by volunteers |	# 
Radio spots/SMS messages/television spots broadcast |	# 
Respondents that correctly recall messages on symptoms/transmission/prevention/case definition for referral |	% 
Knowledge of target population on recommended prevention and control behaviours |	% increase



# Impact on other sectors/program areas 

Dependant on the infectious agent and factors and context of the underlying population and environment.
