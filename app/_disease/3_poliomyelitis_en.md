# FACT SHEET

## Importance

In 2017, 22 cases of Polio were reported worldwide (in Afghanistan and Pakistan). Of the three strains of wild poliovirus (type 1, type 2, and type 3), wild poliovirus type 2 was eradicated in 1999 and no case of wild poliovirus type 3 has been found since the last reported case in Nigeria in November 2012.  As the world moves towards the elimination of Polio, the importance of rapid detection and control of community cases is extremely important. One case is considered an outbreak that warrants a full response.

## Case definition	

**Clinical case definition:** 
Any child under 15 years of age with Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) (including Guillain-Barré syndrome) or any person of any age with paralytic illness if polio is suspected.

**Case classification:** 
- Suspected case: A case that meets the clinical case definition.
- Confirmed case: See diagram.

<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Alert/Epidemic threshold	

In a country that has been free from Polio for at least six months, a poliovirus outbreak is:
- a single or multiple case(s) of poliomyelitis due to wild polio virus (WPV) or vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV);
- a positive environmental sample for WPV/VDPV given that:
  - two or more separate samples contain WPV/VDPV with genetic sequencing information that indicates sustained local transmission; or
  - a single sample is positive for WPV/VDPV and follow-up investigation identifies polio compatible cases or WPV/VDPV infected persons.


</div> 
<!-- end ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->

## Risk assessment	

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices, immunisation coverage

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality

**Environment:** shelter, availability of safe food and water, appropriate sanitation facilities (including treatment and/or safe final disposal of sewage) and availability and access to health and social care.


<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate		

- 28% (includes minor and major clinical manifestations; 24% with minor illness, 4% non-paralytic aseptic meningitis; and 0.5% paralysis). 
- Mortality rate among paralytic cases approximately 5%.


</div> 
<!-- end ## Attack rate -->

## Vulnerability	

Children who are not vaccinated. People living in an area where the polio virus is circulating that have damaged, non-functioning or non-existent WASH infrastructure.

## Infectious agent	

Polio virus

## Reservoir/Host	

Humans

</div> 
<!-- end ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->

## How the disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	

- Hands or objects (i.e. toys) contaminated with the stools of infected people;
- Less common: contaminated drinking water and food, droplets from a sneeze or cough.


<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period	

Seven to ten days (range 4–35 days).

## Period of infectiousness	

An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and about one to two weeks after symptoms appear. The virus can live in an infected person’s faeces for many weeks. It can contaminate food and water in unsanitary conditions.

## Clinical signs and symptoms	

- Most people who get infected with poliovirus (about 72 out of 100) will not have any visible symptoms.
- About one in four people with poliovirus infection will have flu-like symptoms that may include: sore throat, fever, tiredness, nausea, headache and stomach pain.
- These symptoms usually last two to five days then go away on their own.
- A smaller proportion of people with poliovirus infection will develop other more serious symptoms that affect the brain and spinal cord: paraesthesia (feeling of pins and needles in the legs) and Meningitis (infection of the covering of the spinal cord and/or brain) occurs in about 1 out of 25 people with poliovirus infection.
- Paralysis (can’t move parts of the body) or weakness in the arms, legs, or both, occurs in about 1 out of 200 people with poliovirus infection.
- Paralysis is the most severe symptom associated with polio because it can lead to permanent disability and death. Between 2 -10% people who have paralysis from poliovirus infection die because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.
- Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 15 to 40 years later. This is called post-Polio syndrome.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms	

Various neurological illnesses and other diseases with paralysis.

## Diagnosis

Poliovirus can be detected in specimens from the throat, and faeces (stool), and occasionally cerebrospinal fluid, by isolating the virus in cell culture or by detecting the virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

There is no cure for Polio. The focus is on increasing comfort, speeding up recovery and preventing complications. 
- Supportive treatments include: bed rest, pain relievers, portable ventilators to assist breathing, moderate exercise (physical therapy) to prevent deformity and loss of muscle function, a nutritious diet.
- There are two types of vaccines that can prevent Polio: inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV, including monovalent, bivalent and trivalent).

  
## Immunity	

- Poliovirus infection can provide lifelong immunity against the disease, but this protection is limited to the serotype involved. Infection with one type does not protect an individual against infection with the other two types.
- Vaccine efficacy is approximately 90% for the prevention of paralysis.
