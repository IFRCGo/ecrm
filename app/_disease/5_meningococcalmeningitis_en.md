# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Meningococcal meningitis occurs in small clusters throughout the world with seasonal variation. It accounts for a variable proportion of epidemic bacterial meningitis.

The largest burden of Meningococcal disease occurs in an area of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ‘Meningitis belt’, which stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. During the dry season between December to June, climatic conditions and an increase in upper respiratory tract infections combine to damage the nasopharyngeal mucosa, increasing the risk of Meningococcal disease. At the same time, transmission of N. meningitidis may be facilitated by overcrowded housing and by large population displacements at the regional level due to pilgrimages and traditional markets. Although Meningitis outbreaks are decreasing in size and frequency with the increase of vaccinations, they still pose a significant risk. Fatality rate is 10%-15%, up to 40% in Meningococcaemia.


## Case definition	

**Suspected case of acute meningitis:**  sudden onset of fever (>38.5 °C rectal or 38.0 °C axillary) WITH stiff neck. In patients under one year of age, a suspected case of Meningitis occurs when fever is accompanied by a bulging fontanelle.

**Probable case of bacterial Meningitis:** suspected case of acute Meningitis as defined above WITH turbid CSF.

**Probable case of meningococcal Meningitis:** suspected case of either acute or bacterial Meningitis as defined above WITH Gram stain showing Gram-negative diplococcus OR ongoing epidemic OR petechial or purpuric rash.

**Confirmed case:** suspected or probable case as defined above WITH EITHER positive CSF antigen detection for _N. meningitidis_ OR positive culture of CSF or blood with identification of _N. meningitidis_.

<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Alert/Epidemic threshold	

Endemic areas: For areas of population between 30,000 and 100,000: an alert threshold of three cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week; and an epidemic threshold of 10 per 100,000 in one week.

For small populations: alert threshold is either two cases in one week or a higher incidence than in a non-epidemic year; and an epidemic threshold of five cases in one week or a doubling of incidence in a three-week period.

Special situations (mass gatherings, displaced persons camp settings, or closed institutions such as schools or barracks): two cases of Meningococcal disease are confirmed in one week.

Non-endemic areas: Increased incidence of clustered Meningitis cases and causal N. meningitidis pathogen (_N. meningitidis_ A, C, Y, W135) has been confirmed.

## Risk assessment	

**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** immunisation coverage, community practices, cultural practices, nutritional status 

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality

**Environment:** shelter, availability and access to health and social care


<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Attack rate		

The attack rate for household contacts exposed to patients who have sporadic meningococcal disease was estimated to be four cases per 1,000 persons exposed, which is 500–800 times greater than the rate for the total population. 

</div> 
<!-- end ## Attack rate -->

## Vulnerability	

- Infants, teens, and young adults.
- People who live with the patient.
- Anyone with direct contact with the patient’s oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend.
- People living in close quarters.
- Active and passive smokers.
- Military recruits.
- People without spleen, those who have a complement component deficiency, and being infected with HIV.


<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Infectious agent	

_Neisseria meningitidis_ bacterium. There are 12 serogroups of _N. meningitidis_ that have been identified, six of which (A, B, C, W, X and Y) can cause epidemics. Geographic distribution and epidemic potential differ according to serogroup.

## Reservoir/Host	

Humans.

</div> 
<!-- end ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->

## How the disease is spread (Modes of transmission)	

Droplets of saliva/mucus from one person to another, mainly by kissing, coughing or sneezing, or by sharing eating and drinking utensils.


<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2" markdown="1"> 

## Incubation period	

Three to four days (range two to ten days).

## Period of infectiousness	

It is believed that 10% to 20% of the population carries N. meningitidis in their throat at any given time. However, the carriage rate may be higher in epidemic situations.

## Clinical signs and symptoms	

- Starts with sudden high fever and one of the following: neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting.
- If treated early, in 90% of the cases death can be prevented.
- Without treatment, affects the nervous system and can cause death.
- It may result in brain damage, hearing loss or learning disability in 10-20% of survivors.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms	

Meningitis due to other causes.

## Diagnosis

- Initial diagnosis of Meningococcal meningitis can be made by clinical examination followed by a lumbar puncture showing a purulent spinal fluid. 
- The bacteria may sometimes be seen in a microscopic examination of the spinal fluid. 
- The diagnosis is confirmed by growing the bacteria from specimens of spinal fluid or blood, by agglutination tests or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
- The identification of the serogroups and susceptibility testing to antibiotics are important to define control measures.


## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)

- Meningococcal disease is potentially fatal and should always be viewed as a medical emergency. 
- Admission to a hospital or health centre is necessary, although isolation of the patient is not necessary.
- Appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible.


  
## Immunity	

- A previous infection will not offer lifelong protection from future infections.
- Vaccine efficacy is estimated between 63% and 97%, but this decreases in many adolescents within five years.

# Which interventions are most effective for prevention and control? 

The primary control measure is vaccination.  Reduction in exposure to mosquitos through personnel protection or reducing vectors (spraying or environmental sanitation) is a useful supplementary activity. Large urban outbreaks of Yellow Fever are possible, so SBCC strategies should include urban and rural approaches.
