# FACT SHEET

## Importance

Acute respiratory infections (ARI) kill an estimated 3.9 million people per year. They are one of the top five causes of mortality worldwide.
An influenza pandemic occurs when an influenza A virus to which most humans have little or no existing immunity acquires the ability to cause sustained human-to-human transmission. This can lead to community-wide outbreaks. Such a virus has the potential to spread rapidly worldwide, causing a pandemic.
Avian and other zoonotic influenza infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild Conjunctivitis to severe Pneumonia and even death. Over the past ten years, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) has been detected in poultry, wild birds or other animals in over 30 countries, causing over 800 human deaths.  



## Case definition	

Influenza like illness case definition: An acute respiratory infection with measured fever of ≥ 38 C° and cough with onset within the last ten days.
Severe acute respiratory infection case definition: An acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C° and cough, with onset within the last ten days that requires hospitalization.

## Alert/epidemic threshold:
Significant increase over the historical threshold (e.g. an increase of 1.645 standard deviations).
Two linked cases of severe respiratory illness should trigger investigation.


## Risk assessment
**Event description:** type of disaster, characteristics of displacement

**Host:** community practices, cultural practices

**Agent:** endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality

**Environment:** immunisation coverage, shelter, availability and access to health and social care.

## Attack rate: 
- It depends on the agent.
- About two-thirds of people with pandemic influenza are expected to develop clinical symptoms. Averaged overall (across all age groups), population clinical attack rates are expected to be 25% to 45%.
- 12% to 89% for RSV during outbreaks.

## Vulnerable people:
- Infants and young children, and the elderly
- Patients with sickle cell disease, asplenia, HIV, and certain immunoglobulin and complement component deficiencies, as well as recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant and chemotherapy or radiation therapy for malignant neoplasms are at increased risk for invasive H. influenzae disease.
- Children younger than 2 years of age with chronic lung or heart conditions, and children with weakened immune systems

## Infectious agent:
Respiratory viruses are implicated in about half of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases in children, over 90% of bronchiolitis cases in infants, and 85-95% of asthma exacerbations in children. 
In adults, respiratory viruses are implicated in 30-50% of CAP cases, 80% of asthma exacerbations, and 20-60% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Other infections are caused by respiratory bacteria or fungi. The most common virus that causes pneumonia is Respiratory syncytial virus and the most common bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B.

## Reservoir/Host:
Mainly only humans, but for some causes they might by animals as well (particularly birds for Avian influenza).

## How disease is spread (Modes of transmission):
- Droplets of saliva/mucus from one person to another, mainly while coughing or sneezing, or airborne droplets
- Close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions
- Rarely through food or from animals.

## Incubation period:
Depending on the infectious agent (e.g. for influenza virus and Str. pneumoniae one to three days, for RSV four to six days)

## Period of infectiousness:
Depending on the infectious agent. This includes five days for influenza virus, three to eight days for RSV, but longer in infants, young children and people with compromised immune system.

## Clinical signs and symptoms:
- ARI’s can occur in any part of the respiratory system, from the middle ear to the nose to the lungs.
- Most ARI’s result in mild illnesses, such as the common cold. But in vulnerable children, infections that begin with mild symptoms may sometimes lead to more severe illnesses, such as Pneumonia.  
- Children with Pneumonia may have a range of symptoms depending on their age and the cause of the infection. Bacterial pneumonia usually causes children to become severely ill with high fever and rapid breathing.  Viral infections often come on gradually and may worsen over time.
- Some common symptoms of Pneumonia in children and infants include rapid or difficult breathing, cough, fever, chills, headaches, loss of appetite and wheezing. 
- Children under five years of age with severe cases of Pneumonia may struggle to breathe, with their chests moving in or retracting during inhalation (known as ‘lower chest wall indrawing’). 
- Young infants may suffer convulsions, unconsciousness, hypothermia, lethargy and feeding problems.


## Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms:
Some other infections may start with respiratory symptoms such as Measles, Chicken pox and Rubella.


## Diagnosis:
- Chest X-rays and laboratory tests are used to confirm the presence of Pneumonia, including the extent and location of the infection and the cause. In resource-poor settings, suspected cases of Pneumonia are diagnosed by their clinical symptoms.
- Laboratory diagnosis depends on the infectious agent. It includes isolation, rapid tests (e.g. for respiratory syncytial virus), serology and other techniques.

## Clinical management (vaccine or treatment):
- Treatment of severe infections usually requires antibiotics and hospitalisations are common.
- Cotrimoxazole and Amoxicillin are effective drugs against bacterial pathogens and are often used to treat children with pneumonia in developing countries. 
- Infants under two months of age with signs of pneumonia/sepsis are at risk of suffering severe illness and death more quickly than older children. They should be immediately referred to a hospital or clinic for treatment.
- Antiviral drugs for Influenza are available in some countries and may reduce severe complications and deaths.

## Immunity:
Immunity after infection is often only partial (RSV), and serotype/strain specific (Str. pneumonia, influenza) and re-infections may happen.

## Prevention:
- Health promotion
- Increased air flow in housing
- Reduction of overcrowding
- Improving the nutritional status, especially of children
- Coughing etiquette
- Immunisation (against Measles, Influenza virus, H. influenzae type B, S. pneumoniae) 
- Exclusive breastfeeding
- Zinc supplementation.
