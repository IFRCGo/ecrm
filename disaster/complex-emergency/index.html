<h2 id="key-facts">Key facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Often results from a combination of hazards including manmade and natural.</li>
  <li>Underlying factors include conflict and drought</li>
  <li>Can result in significant population movement, epidemics, lack of access to health care and general insecurity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="main-health-impacts">Main health impacts</h2>

<p>Complex emergencies often result in the collapse of the health system.  Insecurity often means additional or supplementary services are not always available.  The population is often affected by malnutrition, epidemics and poor health in general.</p>
