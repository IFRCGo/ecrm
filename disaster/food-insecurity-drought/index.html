<h2 id="key-facts">Key facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Persistent food and nutrition insecurity continues to be a chronic problem globally. One in eight adults and one in four children worldwide are chronically malnourished.</li>
  <li>Drought is the most common cause of food shortages.</li>
  <li>Other underlying factors include conflict, poverty and lack of agricultural infrastructure.</li>
  <li>These factors are exacerbated by environmental degradation and climate change.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="main-health-impacts">Main health impacts</h2>

<p>One of the main concerns with food insecurity is insufficient nutrient intake and subsequent malnutrition. Children and adults who are malnourished have an increased risk of severe forms of infections, and higher rates of morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p>Unlike rapid onset disasters, food insecurity has a gradual or slow onset. Response to food insecurity includes nutrition specific interventions aimed at preventing or treating acute malnutrition, and nutrition sensitive interventions aimed at addressing the drought and food insecurity.</p>
