<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>Cholera remains a major public health problem. Each year there are an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of cholera, including 21 000 to 143 000 deaths globally. Approximately 41% of cases are reported from Africa, 37% from Asia and 21% from the Americas.</p>

<p>Primary causes include insufficient access to safe water, proper sanitation and hygiene, and this impact can be exacerbated in areas where basic infrastructure is disrupted or has been destroyed. Countries facing complex emergencies and large population movements (of IDPs or refugees) to overcrowded settings are particularly vulnerable to cholera outbreaks.</p>

<p>The majority of affected countries report an overall cholera case-fatality rate (CFR) of &lt;2%. In some locations the CFR may approach 30- 50% in outbreaks where vulnerable groups have limited access to health care.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<p><strong>Suspected case:</strong> in an area where the disease is not known to be present, a patient aged five years or more develops severe dehydration or dies from acute watery diarrhoea; in an area where there is a Cholera epidemic, a patient aged five years or more develops acute watery diarrhoea (AWD), with or without vomiting.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed case:</strong> <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> serotype O1 or serotype O139 is isolated (in a laboratory) from any patient with diarrhoea.</p>

<p>In children under five years of age, several pathogens can produce symptoms similar to those of Cholera. Therefore, children under five are often not included in the case definition of Cholera.</p>

<!-- start ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="alertepidemic-threshold">Alert/Epidemic threshold</h2>

  <p>A Cholera outbreak/epidemic is defined by the occurrence of at least one confirmed case of Cholera, with evidence of local transmission in an area where there is not usually Cholera.</p>

  <p>In endemic areas, an outbreak is defined as a significant increase in the baseline number of cases of Cholera (more cases reported than is expected for that period).</p>

</div>
<!-- end ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->

<h2 id="risk-assessment">Risk assessment</h2>

<p><strong>Event description:</strong> type of disaster, characteristics of displacement</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> malnutrition rates, community and cultural practices with a focus on related to hygiene, water, sanitation and accessing information and healthcare</p>

<p><strong>Agent:</strong> endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality, seasonality, vaccine coverage</p>

<p><strong>Environment:</strong> shelter, availability of safe food, availability of WASH facilities, availability and access to health and social care</p>

<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="attack-rate">Attack rate</h2>

  <p>Likely attack rate in refugee camps, with high-risk populations (because of malnutrition), is 3 to 5 % but can be higher in vulnerable populations  (in rural communities 0.5% and in urban contexts 1%).</p>

</div>
<!-- end ## Attack rate -->

<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Individuals living in places with a lack of access to safe water and poor sanitation and hygiene are at a greater risk, particularly young children</li>
  <li>Individuals with chronic medical conditions (HIV infection, malnourished children, etc.)</li>
  <li>Those without ready access to rehydration therapy and medical services</li>
  <li>Individuals with achlorhydria (the absence of hydrochloric acid in digestive stomach juices) Individuals with blood type O</li>
</ul>

<!-- start ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="infectious-agent">Infectious agent</h2>

  <p><em>Vibrio cholerae</em> bacterium; there are two serogroups – O1 and O139 and two biotypes – classical and El Tor.</p>

  <p>Humans</p>

</div>
<!-- end ## Infectious agent + Reservoir/Host	 -->

<h2 id="how-the-disease-is-spread-modes-of-transmission">How the disease is spread (Modes of transmission)</h2>

<p><strong>Faecal Oral</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Water contaminated with human faeces (from someone who has Cholera) is the main mode of transmission.</li>
  <li>Contaminated food (by contaminated water, hands, utensils, added ice).</li>
  <li>Hands contaminated by excreta from someone who has Cholera can contaminate food and cause new infections.</li>
  <li>Care should also be taken when handling the bodies of those who have died due to Cholera, ensuring strict disinfection and infection prevention/control measures.</li>
  <li>The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another by casual contact with an infected person.</li>
</ul>

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="incubation-period">Incubation period</h2>

  <p>Twelve hours to five days.</p>

  <h2 id="period-of-infectiousness">Period of infectiousness</h2>

  <p>Most people infected with <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for one to ten days after infection and are shed (excreted) back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. This is important when considering interventions aimed at stopping transmission via contact tracing alone.</p>

<div class="hide profile2 profile3">

  <h2 id="clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Approximately one in ten infected persons will have severe disease.</li>
    <li>Severe disease is characterized by profuse watery diarrhoea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these cases, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="other-diseases-with-similar-clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <p>Other infectious diarrhoea, amoebic dysentery, food poisoning, parasitic diseases.</p>

  <h2 id="clinical-management-vaccine-or-treatment">Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Dehydration stage: No dehydration
      <ul>
        <li>Signs: Skin goes back normally when pinched, thirst has subsided, urine has been passed, pulse is strong.</li>
        <li>Treatment: Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) at home; zinc supplementation in children up to 15 years.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dehydration stage: Moderate dehydration
      <ul>
        <li>Signs: Restlessness and irritability, sunken eyes, dry mouth and tongue, increased thirst, skin goes back slowly when pinched, decreased urine, decreased tears, depressed fontanels in infants.</li>
        <li>Treatment: ORS + very close observation; zinc supplementation in children up to 15 years.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dehydration stage: Severe dehydration
      <ul>
        <li>Signs: Lethargy or unconsciousness, very dry mouth and tongue, skin goes back very slowly when pinched (“tenting”), weak or absent pulse, low blood pressure, minimal or no urine.</li>
        <li>Treatment: Intravenous (IV) therapy + antibiotics + ORS; zinc supplementation in children up to 15 years.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="immunity">Immunity</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Previous infection with classical Cholera provides protection against subsequent disease lasting between six to ten years.  Previous infection with El Tor Cholera provides protection against subsequent disease lasting three to six years.</li>
    <li>Cholera vaccine efficacy in the first two years after vaccination is 66% in those &gt; five years of age, but only 38% to 43% for children &lt;5 years of age.</li>
  </ul>
