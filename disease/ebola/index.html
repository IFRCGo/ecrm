<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, in what is now South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.</p>

<p>The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered. There were more cases and deaths in 2014-2016 than all the previous years combined. The outbreak also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p>

<p>The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<p><strong>Routine surveillance</strong></p>

<p><strong>Suspected case:</strong> Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment for usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed case:</strong> A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation).</p>

<p><strong>Community-based surveillance</strong></p>

<p>Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area OR at least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine OR any sudden death.</p>

<p>During an Ebola outbreak, surveillance should use the case definitions described.</p>
