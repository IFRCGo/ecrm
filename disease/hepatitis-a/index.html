<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>Hepatitis A occurs sporadically globally. In low income countries with poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, nearly 90% of children have been infected with the Hepatitis A virus before the age of ten years. Those infected in childhood do not experience any noticeable symptoms. Epidemics are uncommon here because older children and adults are generally immune.</p>

<p>In middle- and high-income countries with good sanitation and hygiene conditions, infection rates are low. Hepatitis A may occur among adolescents and adults in high-risk groups, such as injecting-drug users, men who have sex with men, people travelling to areas of high endemicity, and in isolated populations, such as closed religious communities. However, when the virus gets introduced in such communities, the presence of good sanitation and hygiene practices stops person-to-person transmission, stopping the outbreak rapidly.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<p><strong>Clinical criteria:</strong> person meeting the criteria for acute Hepatitis - discrete onset of an acute illness with signs/symptoms of (i) acute
viral illness (e.g. fever, malaise, fatigue) and (ii) liver damage, which can be clinical (e.g. anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, right upper quadrant tenderness), and/or biochemical (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal).</p>

<p><strong>Biomarker criterion:</strong> positive for IgM anti-HAV</p>

<p><strong>Epidemiological criteria:</strong> epidemiological link to a case confirmed with biomarker (i.e. contact with a person with Hepatitis A confirmed with biomarker testing 2–6 weeks before onset, or occurrence in the context of an outbreak confirmed by biomarker testing).</p>

<p><strong>Case classification</strong></p>

<p><strong>Confirmed:</strong> a case of acute Hepatitis with biomarker positivity OR a case of acute Hepatitis with epidemiological link to a case confirmed with biomarker positivity.</p>

<!-- start ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="alertepidemic-threshold">Alert/epidemic threshold</h2>

  <p>An outbreak of Hepatitis is often suspected by a clinical health-care worker, who notices an unusual number of patients with acute jaundice syndrome within a short period of time. These patients present with one or more of the following features: similar clinical symptoms, residence in the same area or location, sharing the same water supply.</p>

  <p>If baseline information from the same geographical area for previous years is available, it can be used to verify whether the number of cases in the present year is unusually high compared to that in previous years over the same period.</p>

  <p>For acute jaundice syndrome in emergency settings, alert thresholds of “five or more cases with acute jaundice syndrome in one location in one to a few weeks” and of “five cases with acute jaundice syndrome or 1.5 times the baseline rate” have been suggested to help early detection of potential outbreaks of Hepatitis.</p>

  <h2 id="clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Some sufferers, especially children, show no signs of having the disease at all</li>
    <li>Symptoms include fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, dark urine, and yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="other-diseases-with-similar-clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <p>Other viral Hepatitis, Yellow fever, Leptospirosis, Dengue fever, falciparum Malaria.</p>

  <h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cases of Hepatitis A are not clinically distinguishable from other types of acute viral Hepatitis.</li>
    <li>Specific diagnosis is made by the detection of HAV-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgM) antibodies in the blood.</li>
    <li>Additional tests include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the Hepatitis A virus RNA and may require specialised laboratory facilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="clinical-management-vaccine-or-treatment">Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>There is no specific treatment for Hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and may take several weeks or months. Most important is the avoidance of unnecessary medications. Acetaminophen / Paracetamol and medication against vomiting should not be given.</li>
    <li>Hospitalization is unnecessary in the absence of acute liver failure. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea.</li>
    <li>Hepatitis A vaccine is used in 16 countries. Planning for large-scale immunization programmes should involve careful economic evaluations and consider alternative or additional prevention methods, such as improved sanitation, and health education for improved hygiene practices. Whether or not to include the vaccine in routine childhood immunizations depends on the local context.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="immunity">Immunity</h2>
