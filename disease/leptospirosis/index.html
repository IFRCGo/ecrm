<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>Leptospirosis is endemic in many countries, especially in tropical and subtropical areas with high rainfall. The disease is found mainly where humans come into contact with the urine of infected animals or a urine-polluted environment. Outbreaks of Leptospirosis have been reported following natural disasters such as flooding or cyclones.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<p><strong>Clinical description:</strong> The usual presentation is an acute febrile illness with headache, myalgia (particularly calf muscle) and prostration associated with any of the following symptoms/signs: conjunctival suffusion, anuria or oliguria, jaundice, cough, haemoptysis and breathlessness, haemorrhages (from the intestines; lung bleeding is notorious in some areas), meningeal irritation, cardiac arrhythmia or failure, skin rash. Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and arthralgia. The clinical diagnosis is difficult where diseases with symptoms similar to those of leptospirosis occur frequently.</p>

<p><strong>Case classification (humans)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Suspected:</strong> A case that is compatible with the clinical description and a presumptive laboratory diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed:</strong> A suspect case with a confirmatory laboratory diagnosis.</p>

</div>
<!-- end -->

<h2 id="how-disease-is-spread-modes-of-transmission">How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Through cuts and abrasions of the skin, or through the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals. As animals are constantly in our environment, there is a particular danger of getting Leptospirosis when flooding occurs, such as following a typhoon or very heavy seasonal rains, because of exposure to contaminated water when wading in floodwaters.</li>
  <li>Leptospirosis can occasionally also be transmitted through the drinking of water or ingestion of food contaminated with urine of infected animals, often rats.</li>
  <li>Human-to-human transmission occurs only very rarely (by sexual intercourse, and trans-placentally from the mother to the fetus and via breast milk to a child).</li>
</ul>

  <h2 id="clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <p>In general, the disease presents in four broad clinical categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A mild, influenza-like illness</li>
    <li>Weil’s syndrome characterized by jaundice, renal failure, haemorrhage and myocarditis with arrhythmias</li>
    <li>Meningitis/meningoencephalitis</li>
    <li>Pulmonary haemorrhage with respiratory failure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="other-diseases-with-similar-clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <p>Influenza, Dengue Fever, Hantavirus infection, Yellow fever and other haemorrhagic fevers, Malaria and Typhoid fever.</p>

  <h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The disease is usually diagnosed in the laboratory by detecting antibodies, (serodiagnosis), by culturing the bacteria from blood, urine or tissues, or by demonstrating the presence of leptospires in tissues using antibodies labelled with fluorescent markers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="clinical-management-vaccine-or-treatment">Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Leptospirosis can be treated with antibiotics that should be given as early in the course of illness as possible.</li>
    <li>Commercial human vaccines have been produced in France and Cuba. However, these vaccines do not induce long-term protection against infection and do not provide cross-protective immunity against the different types of leptospira.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="immunity">Immunity</h2>

  <p>The level and duration of immunity is unclear and can vary</p>
