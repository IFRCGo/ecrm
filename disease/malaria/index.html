<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>In 2016, 91 countries and areas had ongoing Malaria transmission. The WHO estimates there were 216 million cases of Malaria in 2016 and 445,000 deaths. Countries in Africa reported 90% of cases and 92% of deaths of Malaria globally.</p>

<p>Malaria epidemics do not generally occur in high-transmission areas (other than when there is migration of non-immune persons into these areas). This is because the population has developed partial immunity to the disease. Continuous exposure to Malaria infection provides immunity in people after a certain age but this immunity is transient. People who remain uninfected over a short period (less than one year) become newly susceptible to the disease. Therefore, those living in areas of seasonal or low transmission do not develop adequate immunity and can be vulnerable to the disease every season.</p>

<p>Since epidemics occur in areas where populations have inadequate immunity, Malaria cases can be high, with very high rates of morbidity and mortality.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<p>Case definitions for Malaria control (different case definitions are used for Malaria elimination)</p>

<p><strong>Suspected Malaria case:</strong> Patient illness is suspected by a health worker to be due to Malaria. The criteria for suspected Malaria usually include fever or a history of fever. These criteria vary according to local circumstances and are established by the national malaria control programme. All suspected cases of Malaria are tested by either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT).</p>

<p><strong>Presumed (not tested) Malaria case:</strong> In a suspected Malaria case, the patient did not receive a diagnostic test but was nevertheless treated for Malaria. Such cases have also been referred to as ‘probable’ cases. However, in most settings, the chance that a suspected case will be confirmed is &lt; 50%, and so the use of the term ‘probable’ is inappropriate. Such cases are also referred to as ‘unconfirmed’ cases. In this guide, the term used is ‘presumed Malaria case’.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed Malaria case:</strong> A suspected case of Malaria in which Malaria parasites have been demonstrated, generally by microscopy or an RDT, becomes a confirmed case. The definition implies that the patient displayed symptoms of Malaria, and the presence of parasites was confirmed. In some suspected cases with a positive test, particularly in populations that have acquired immunity to Malaria, febrile illness may be due to other causes. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of confirmed Malaria is still given. If a concurrent disease is suspected, it should be further investigated and treated.</p>

  <p>Not directly transmitted person to person. Humans may infect mosquitoes if infectious parasites are in the blood This varies with parasite species and with response to treatment.</p>

    <li>In very severe cases, weakness, loss of consciousness, severe anaemia, acute respiratory and renal failure.</li>
    <li>Children with severe Malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral Malaria. In adults, multi-organ involvement is also frequent.</li>

  <h2 id="clinical-management-vaccine-or-treatment">Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Artemisinin</em>-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated Malaria caused by the <em>P. falciparum</em> parasite.</li>
    <li><em>P. vivax</em> infections should be treated with an ACT or chloroquine in areas without chloroquine-resistant <em>P. vivax</em>. In areas where chloroquine-resistant P. vivax has been identified, infections should be treated with an ACT, preferably one in which the partner medicine has a long half-life.</li>
    <li>To prevent relapses, primaquine should be added to the treatment</li>
    <li>Severe Malaria should be treated with injectable artesunate (intramuscular or intravenous) for at least 24 hours and followed by a complete three-day course of an ACT once the patient can tolerate oral medicines. When injectable treatment cannot be given, children under six years of age with severe Malaria should receive a pre-referral treatment with rectal artesunate before being referred immediately to a health care facility where the full level of care can be provided.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="immunity">Immunity</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>An immune response has occurred following natural infection, however complete protective immunity does not develop, because repeated infections occur in individuals living in endemic areas.</li>

<h1 id="which-interventions-are-most-effective-for-prevention-and-control">Which interventions are most effective for prevention and control?</h1>

<p>The primary control measure is vaccination.  Reduction in exposure to mosquitos through personnel protection or reducing vectors (spraying or environmental sanitation) is a useful supplementary activity. Large urban outbreaks of Yellow Fever are possible, so SBCC strategies should include urban and rural approaches.</p>
