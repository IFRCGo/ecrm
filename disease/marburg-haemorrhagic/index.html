<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>Outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa (in a person with recent travel history to Zimbabwe) and Uganda. In 2008, two independent cases were reported in travellers who visited a cave inhabited by Rousettus bat colonies in Uganda.  Case fatality rates in Marburg haemorrhagic fever (MHF) outbreaks have ranged from 24% to 88%.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<p><strong>Routine surveillance</strong></p>

<p><strong>Suspected case:</strong> Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment for usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed case:</strong> A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation)</p>

<p><strong>Community-based surveillance</strong></p>

<p>Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area OR at least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine OR any sudden death.</p>

<p>During a Marburg outbreak, surveillance should use the case definitions described in one of the references (see below).</p>

<p><strong>Event description:</strong> : contact with fruit bats colonies</p>

<h2 id="how-disease-is-spread-modes-of-transmission">How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons</li>
  <li>Contact with the body of the deceased during burial ceremonies</li>
  <li>Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries</li>
  <li>Sexual contact with a man up to seven weeks after recovery</li>
  <li>Contact with fruit bats and probably apes and monkeys.</li>

  <h2 id="period-of-infectiousness">Period of infectiousness</h2>

  <p>People remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Recovering patients are no longer contagious to others and their return home or transfer to a general hospital is safe. Sperm may still be contagious for a period of three months after patient’s recovery.</p>
