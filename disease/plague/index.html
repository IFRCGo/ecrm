<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and almost  always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated. .In 2015 there were 320 cases reported worldwide, including 77 deaths. Plague is found in all continents, except Oceania. Currently, the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. There is a risk of human plague wherever the presence of plague natural foci (the bacteria, an animal reservoir and a vector) and human population co-exist.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<p><strong>Clinical description:</strong> Disease characterized by rapid onset of fever, chills, headache, severe malaise, prostration, WITH extreme painful swelling of lymph nodes (bubonic form) OR cough with blood-stained sputum, chest pain, difficult breathing (pneumonic form); both forms can progress to a septicaemic form with toxaemia: sepsis without evident buboes rarely occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis:</strong> Confirmation of plague requires laboratory testing.Isolation of Yersinia pestis in cultures from buboes, blood, CSF or sputum OR detecting  specific Y. pestis antigen using different techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Case classification</strong></p>

<p><strong>Suspected:</strong> Any person meeting the clinical criteria with at least one the epidemiological criteria. 
Bubonic plague: Fever AND sudden onset of painful lymphadenitis
OR</p>

<p><strong>Pneumonic plague:</strong> Fever AND at least one of the following three:
Cough, Chest pain, Haemoptysis</p>

<p><strong>Probable:</strong> Any person meeting the clinical criteria with at least one of the laboratory criteria for a probable case (positive direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test for Y. pestis in clinical specimen OR passive haemagglutination test, with antibody titre of at least 1:10, specific for the F1 antigen of Y.pestis as determined by the haemagglutination inhibition test (HI) OR epidemiological link with a confirmed case.)</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed:</strong> A suspected or probable case that is laboratory-confirmed.</p>

<!-- start ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="alertepidemic-threshold">Alert/epidemic threshold</h2>

  <p>One confirmed case is sufficient to identify potential outbreak but this needs to be interpreted in context. (e.g confirmed pulmonary plague case in urban context requires immediate intervention)</p>

</div>
<!-- end -->

<h2 id="risk-assessment">Risk assessment</h2>

<p><strong>Event description:</strong> type of disaster, characteristics of displacement,</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong>population density, community practices, cultural practices</p>

<p><strong>Agent:</strong> endemicity, recent epidemics, ongoing prevention and control interventions, disease incidence, mortality and seasonality</p>

<p><strong>Environment:</strong> presence of plague natural foci, shelter, availability and access to health and social care</p>

<!-- start ## Attack rate -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="attack-rate">Attack rate</h2>
  <p>During epidemics of Dengue, attack rates among susceptible are often 40 - 50%, but may reach 80 - 90%.</p>

</div>
<!-- end -->

<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>

<p>There is a risk of human plague wherever the presence of plague natural foci (the bacteria, an animal reservoir and a vector) and human population co-exist for more details see here: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/plague/Plague-map-2016.pdf?ua=1) 
Pneumonic form is invariably fatal unless treated early, but even bubonic plague has case-fatality ratio of 30-60%.</p>

<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="infectious-agent">Infectious agent</h2>

  <p>Yersinia pestis bacterium.</p>

  <h2 id="reservoirhost">Reservoir/Host</h2>

  <p>Rodents, humans, some other animals.</p>

</div>
<!-- end -->

<h2 id="how-disease-is-spread-modes-of-transmission">How disease is spread (Modes of transmission)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bites of infected fleas (Bubonic plague, septicemic plague, pneumonic plague), particularly Xenopsylla cheopis (Oriental rat flea).</li>
  <li>Touching or skinning infected animals (such as prairie dogs, squirrels, rats, and rabbits), (Bubonic plague, Septicemic plague, Pneumonic plague)</li>
  <li>Inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal (especially sick cats), (Pneumonic plague).</li>
</ul>

<!-- start ## Incubation period	+  Period of infectiousness		 -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="incubation-period">Incubation period</h2>

  <p>One to seven days.</p>

  <h2 id="period-of-infectiousness">Period of infectiousness</h2>

  <p>Only humans with Pneumonic plague can transmit the infection to others. Patients in the early stage of pneumonic plague (approximately the first 20–24 h) apparently pose little risk. Patients in the final stages of disease who cough sputum with much visible blood and/or pus pose the highest risk of infection.</p>

  <h2 id="clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea.</li>
    <li>Bubonic plague: a lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful; it can turn into open sores with a discharge.</li>
    <li>Septicemic plague: abdominal pain, shock, and possibly bleeding into the skin and other organs. Skin and other tissues may turn black and die, especially the fingers, toes, and the nose.</li>
    <li>Pneumonic plague: rapidly developing Pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery mucous; it may cause respiratory failure and shock.
 breathing and bleeding (known as “dengue haemorrhagic fever”).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="other-diseases-with-similar-clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <p>Anthrax, bacterial pneumonia, bacterial sepsis, brucellosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other infections.</p>

  <h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Identification of Y. pestis in a sample of fluid from a bubo, or blood or sputum.</li>
    <li>Rapid dipstick tests have been validated for field use to quickly screen for Y. pestis antigen in patient.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="clinical-management-vaccine-or-treatment">Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Untreated plague can quickly be fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and the reduction of complications.</li>
    <li>Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against Plague if patients are diagnosed in time.</li>
    <li>Pneumonic plague patients must be isolated and cared by trained medical staff with personal protective equipment. Prophylaxis should be provided to close contacts of a pneumonic plague patient.(e.f HCW)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="immunity">Immunity</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Individuals who survived the Plague infection are considered to have acquired immunity against subsequent reinfection of Y. pestis.</li>
