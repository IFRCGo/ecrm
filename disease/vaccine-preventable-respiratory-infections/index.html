<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>Chickenpox, Rubella and Mumps are viral infections and Whooping cough is a bacterial infection that usually cause mild respiratory infections. Sometimes they can lead to severe complications and death. Epidemics of these infections occur in communities with low immunisation coverage. Varicella zoster virus is present worldwide, and, in the absence of a varicella vaccination programme, most people become infected by mid-adulthood. The global annual varicella disease burden includes 4.2 million severe complications leading to hospitalization, and 4200 deaths.</p>

<p>Rubella infection in pregnant women may cause foetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). There are 100 000 babies born with CRS globally each year. Mumps infections can lead to severe complications and Whooping cough is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in infants worldwide Periodic large outbreaks of the infections occur with an inter-epidemic cycle of two to five years.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<h3 id="chickenpox">Chickenpox</h3>

<p><strong>Clinical case definition:</strong> An illness with acute onset of diffuse (generalized) maculopapular vesicular rash without other apparent cause. In vaccinated persons who develop varicella more than 42 days after vaccination (breakthrough disease), the disease is usually mild with fewer than 50 skin lesions and shorter duration of illness. The rash may also be atypical in appearance (maculopapular with few or no vesicles).</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory criteria:</strong> Isolation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) from a clinical specimen OR detection of VZV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests from a clinical specimen, ideally scabs, vesicular fluid, or cells from the base of a lesion OR fourfold or greater rise in serum varicella IgG antibody titre by any standard serologic assay.</p>

<h3 id="varicella-case-classification">Varicella Case Classification</h3>

<p><strong>Probable:</strong> A case that meets the clinical case definition but is not laboratory confirmed nor epidemiologically linked to another probable or confirmed case</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed:</strong> A case that is laboratory confirmed or that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed or a probable case</p>

<h3 id="rubella">Rubella</h3>

<p><strong>Suspected rubella case:</strong> Any patient of any age in whom a health worker suspects Rubella. A health worker should suspect Rubella when a patient presents with: fever, maculopapular rash; and cervical, suboccipital or postauricular adenopathy or arthralgia/arthritis</p>

<p><strong>Clinical confirmation:</strong> Rubella cannot be confirmed clinically: laboratory confirmation is required</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory-confirmed Rubella case:</strong> Because of the difficulty of clinical diagnosis of rubella, laboratory confirmation is required. A laboratory-confirmed case is a suspected case with a positive blood test for Rubella-specific IgM. The blood specimen should be obtained within 28 days after the onset of rash</p>

<p><strong>Epidemiologically confirmed rubella case:</strong> A patient with a febrile rash illness that is linked epidemiologically to a laboratory-confirmed Rubella case</p>

<h3 id="congenital-rubella-syndrome-crs">Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)</h3>

<p><strong>Suspected CRS case:</strong> Any infant less than one year of age in whom a health worker suspects CRS. A health worker should suspect CRS when an infant 0-11 months of age presents with heart disease and/or suspicion of deafness and/or one or more of the following eye signs: white pupil (cataract), diminished vision, pendular movement of the eyes (nystagmus), squint, smaller eye ball (microphthalmia), or larger eye ball (congenital glaucoma). A health worker should also suspect CRS when an infantâ€™s mother has a history of suspected or confirmed Rubella during pregnancy, even when the infant shows no signs of CRS</p>

<p><strong>Clinically confirmed CRS case:</strong> An infant in whom a qualified physician detects at least two of the complications listed in (a) below or one in (a) and one in (b):
(a) Cataract(s), congenital glaucoma, congenital heart disease, loss of hearing, pigmentary retinopathy 
(b) Purpura, splenomegaly, microcephaly, mental retardation, meningoencephalitis, radiolucent bone disease, jaundice that begins within 24 hours after birth</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory confirmed CRS case:</strong> An infant with clinically-confirmed CRS who has a positive blood test for rubella-specific IgM (100% of such infants are positive at the age of 0-5 months of age; 60% are positive at 6-11 months of age). Where special laboratory resources are available the detection of rubella virus in specimens from the pharynx or urine of an infant with suspected CRS provides laboratory confirmation of CRS (60% of such infants shed Rubella virus at the age of 1-4 months of age; 30% at 5-8 months of age: 10% at 9-11 months of age).</p>

<p><strong>Congenital rubella infection (CRI):</strong> If a mother has suspected or confirmed Rubella in pregnancy the infant should have a Rubella-specific IgM blood test. An infant who does not have clinical signs of CRS but who has a positive Rubella-specific IgM test is classified as having congenital Rubella infection (CRI)</p>

<h3 id="mumps">Mumps</h3>

<p><strong>Clinical case definition:</strong> Acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary gland, lasting two or more days and without other apparent cause</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis:</strong> Isolation of mumps virus from an appropriate clinical specimen OR seroconversion or significant (at least fourfold) rise in serum mumps IgG titre as determined by any standard serological assay OR positive serological test for mumps-specific IgM antibodies.</p>

<p><strong>Case classification</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clinical case:</strong> A case that meets the clinical case definition</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory-confirmed:</strong> A case that meets the clinical case definition and is laboratory-confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Epidemiologically confirmed:</strong> A case that meets the clinical case definition and is linked epidemiologically to a laboratory-confirmed case.</p>

<h3 id="whooping-cough">Whooping cough</h3>

<p><strong>Clinical case definition:</strong> A case diagnosed as pertussis by a physician OR a person with a cough lasting at least two weeks with at least one of the following symptoms: paroxysms (i.e. fits) of coughing, inspiratory whooping, post-tussive vomiting (i.e. vomiting immediately after coughing) without other apparent cause.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for laboratory confirmation:</strong> Isolation of Bordetella pertussis OR detection of genomic sequences by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) OR positive paired serology.</p>

  <h2 id="clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Varicella: the first symptoms include fever, malaise and the characteristic itchy rash. Varicella is generally self-limited and vesicles gradually develop crusts, which disappear over a period of seven to ten days. The disease is typically mild, but severe complications may arise, including bacterial infections (e.g. cellulitis, Pneumonia) and neurological complications (e.g. encephalitis).</li>
    <li>In children, Rubella is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (&lt;39Â°C), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50â€“80% of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts one to three days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from three to ten days. When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, there is a 90% chance of passing the virus on to the foetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects known as CRS. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction â€“ many of which require costly therapy, surgeries and other expensive care.</li>
    <li>Mumps typically begins with non-specific symptoms, such as myalgia, headache, malaise and low-grade fever; within a day these are followed by the characteristic unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid glands. Most severe complications are Orchitis, Pancreatitis, Meningitis and spontaneous abortions.</li>
    <li>The first symptoms of Whooping cough include mild fever, runny nose, and cough, which in typical cases gradually develops into a paroxysmal cough followed by whooping (hence the common name of whooping cough). In the youngest infants, the paroxysms may be followed by periods of apnoea. Pneumonia is a relatively common complication; seizures and encephalopathy occur more rarely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="other-diseases-with-similar-clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <p>Measles, Scarlet fever, Roseola infantum, Erythema infectiousum, Monkeypox, Influenza, Parotitis due to other causes, RSV infection, other infections of the respiratory tract.</p>

  <h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Laboratory confirmation of varicella or HZ is by detecting VZV DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or isolating VZV in cell culture from vesicular fluid, crusts, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid or other specimens. Direct immunofluorescence can also be used for rapid testing though this method has lower sensitivity than PCR.</li>
    <li>The presence of Rubella IgM or demonstration of a significant rise in Rubella IgG from paired acute and convalescent serum samples provides evidence of ongoing or recent Rubella infection.</li>
    <li>For Mumps diagnosis, an assay for the detection of Mumps-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies in serum and oral fluid specimens is commercially available.</li>
    <li>Etiological diagnosis of Whooping cough is based on recovering Bordetella  pertussis bacteria from nasopharyngeal specimens obtained during the catarrhal and early paroxysmal stages. Serological diagnosis can be helpful and is usually based on detection of a significant increase in the concentration of specific antibodies against PT in paired serum samples which should be collected during the early catarrhal stage (acute serum) and about one month later (convalescent serum).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="clinical-management-vaccine-or-treatment">Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Varicella is usually self-limited. Severe cases are treated with antiviral medications. Live attenuated varicella vaccine is available.</li>
    <li>There is no specific treatment for Rubella however the disease is preventable by vaccination.</li>
    <li>No specific therapy for Mumps exists, but the disease is preventable by vaccination.</li>
    <li>Whooping cough is treated with antibiotics. Two different types of vaccine (whole-cell â€“ wP and acellular â€“ aP) are used for Whooping cough prevention.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="immunity">Immunity</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Varicella infection usually confers immunity for life.</li>
    <li>Immunity after Rubella infection appears to persist throughout life. However, on rare occasions, serologically documented re-infections have occurred, and re-infection during pregnancy resulting in CRS has been reported.</li>
    <li>Natural Mumps infection confers lifelong protection against the disease, but recurrent Mumps attacks have been reported.</li>
    <li>Natural Whooping cough infection does not confer long-lasting protection against Pertussis. Symptomatic reinfections can occur in adolescents and adults and have also been reported in children.</li>
    <li>Two doses of Chickenpox, Rubella and Mumps vaccine provide high efficiency, while Whooping cough vaccine booster doses are required.</li>
  </ul>
