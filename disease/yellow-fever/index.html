<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>Forty-seven countries in Africa (34) and Central and South America (13) are either endemic for, or have regions that are endemic for, Yellow Fever.</p>

<p>Increased contact between people and infected mosquitoes can lead to an increase in transmission. Many separate villages in an area can develop outbreaks at the same time. This is the most common type of outbreak in Africa.</p>

<p>Occasionally travellers who visit Yellow Fever endemic countries may bring the disease to countries free from Yellow Fever. Large epidemics of Yellow Fever occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with high mosquito density and where most people have little or no immunity, due to lack of vaccination.</p>

<p>Approximately 20-50% of people who develop severe illness from Yellow Fever may die.</p>

<h2 id="case-definition">Case definition</h2>

<p><strong>Suspected case:</strong> Any person with acute onset of fever, with jaundice appearing within 14 days of onset of the first symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Probable case:</strong> A suspected case; and one of the following: presence of Yellow Fever IgM antibody in the absence of Yellow Fever immunization within 30 days before onset of illness; or positive post-mortem liver histopathology; or epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed case:</strong> a) A probable case AND absence of Yellow Fever immunization within 30 days before onset of illness AND one of the following: detection of Yellow Fever-specific neutralizing antibodies. OR b) absence of Yellow Fever immunization within 14 days before onset of illness AND one of the following: detection of Yellow Fever virus genome in blood or other organs by PCR OR detection of Yellow Fever antigen in blood, liver or other organs by immunoassay OR isolation of Yellow Fever virus.</p>

<!-- start ## Alert/Epidemic threshold	 -->
<div class="hide profile2">

  <h2 id="alertepidemic-threshold">Alert/Epidemic threshold</h2>

  <p>One confirmed case is sufficient to identify potential outbreak but this needs to be interpreted in context. For example, vaccination history, specific serologic test with PRNT or PCR; and differential tested and negative. For example, one confirmed case in an unvaccinated urban population requires immediate intervention.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-disease-is-spread-modes-of-transmission">How the disease is spread (Modes of transmission)</h2>

<p>Yellow fever virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of infected <em>Aedes</em> or <em>Haemagogus</em> species mosquitoes. It is primarily a day biting mosquito. The transmission of Yellow Fever has three different cycles: jungle (sylvatic), inter¬mediate (savannah), and urban. It is important to know the difference to ensure the right prevention measures are being used.</p>

<p>The jungle (sylvatic) cycle happens when mosquitos found in the forest canopy infect monkeys. The virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes from monkeys to humans when humans are visiting or working in the jungle. This does not cause large epidemics but should be prevented and controlled quickly.</p>

<p>In Africa, an intermediate (savannah) cycle occurs when the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans living or working at the border of the jungle. Human to human transmission can occur.</p>

<p>The urban cycle involves trans¬mission of the virus between humans and urban mosquitoes, primarily <em>Aedes aegypti</em>. The virus is usually brought to the urban setting by a human who was infected in the jungle or savannah.  This is the type of transmission that can create large epidemics.</p>

<p><strong>Yellow Fever is vaccine preventable.</strong></p>

  <h2 id="incubation-period">Incubation period</h2>

  <p>Six to seven days (range three to ten days).</p>

  <h2 id="period-of-infectiousness">Period of infectiousness</h2>

  <p>People infected with Yellow Fever virus can infect a mosquito shortly before they suffer from a fever and up to five days after they first get sick.  Infected mosquitos go on to infect other people.</p>

  <h2 id="clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Most people infected with the Yellow Fever virus have no illness, or a mild illness only which improves after the initial presentation.</li>
    <li>The initial symptoms include sudden onset of fever, chills, severe headache, back pain, general body aches, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness.</li>
    <li>Approximately 15% of cases progress to develop a more severe form of the disease. This is characterized by high fever, jaundice, bleeding, and eventual shock and failure of multiple organs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="other-diseases-with-similar-clinical-signs-and-symptoms">Other diseases with similar clinical signs and symptoms</h2>

  <p>Other haemorrhagic fevers (Dengue, Rift-Valley fever, Crimean-Congo fever, Lassa fever, Marburg fever, Ebola fever, South-America VHF), viral and non-infectious hepatic diseases, Malaria, Leptospirosis, relapsing fever, Typhus and Typhoid fever.</p>

  <h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Laboratory diagnosis of Yellow Fever by testing serum to detect virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies.</li>
    <li>Sometimes the virus can be found in blood samples taken early in the illness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="clinical-management-vaccine-or-treatment">Clinical management (vaccine or treatment)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>No specific treatments have been found to benefit patients with Yellow Fever. Whenever possible, these patients should be hospitalized for supportive care and close observation.</li>
    <li>Treatment is symptomatic. Rest, fluids, and the use of pain relievers and medication to reduce fever may relieve symptoms.</li>
    <li>Care should be taken to avoid certain medications, such as Aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. Ibuprofen, Naproxen), which may increase the risk of bleeding.</li>
    <li>Yellow Fever patients should be protected from further mosquito exposure (staying indoors and/or under a mosquito net) for up to five days after the onset of fever. This way, the Yellow Fever virus in their bloodstream will be unavailable to uninfected mosquitoes, thus breaking the transmission cycle and reducing risk to the people around them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="immunity">Immunity</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Those who recover from Yellow Fever generally have lasting immunity against subsequent infection.</li>
    <li>The vaccine provides effective immunity within 30 days for 99% of persons vaccinated.</li>
  </ul>

<h1 id="which-interventions-are-most-effective-for-prevention-and-control">Which interventions are most effective for prevention and control?</h1>

<p>The primary control measure is vaccination.  Reduction in exposure to mosquitos through personnel protection or reducing vectors (spraying or environmental sanitation) is a useful supplementary activity. Large urban outbreaks of Yellow Fever are possible, so SBCC strategies should include urban and rural approaches.</p>
